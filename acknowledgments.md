These resources were developed through grant funding from the Department for Education National Prospectus Grants Programme 2013-2015.  This project involved a consortium of [ACE Centre](http://acecentre.org.uk), [Communication Matters](http://www.communicationmatters.org.uk) and [1Voice](http://www.1voice.info).

A big thank you to the people who allowed us to share their stories within these resources.  We also would like to thank Ruth McMorran, Deborah Pugh and [Marion Stanton](http://candleaac.com) for carefully reviewing the resources and their thoughtful comments.
