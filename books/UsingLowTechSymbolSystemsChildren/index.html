<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The aim of this resource is to introduce you to low tech symbol based AAC to enable you to support children who can’t rely on speech to communicate to the best of their ability. Through communication we can express ourselves, learn, have fun, and be active members of society.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a lot of emphasis on communication partner skills in this resource. That is because communication does not happen in isolation – it’s a social act involving two or more people. The person who is communicating with the child who cannot rely on speech needs to develop a range of skills that will enable them to support that child to fulfil their potential.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please note that this resource is not suggesting that low tech is ‘best’, or that low tech is a prerequisite to a more high tech communication aid. It is simply about valuing the role of paper based communication systems, and sharing lots of ideas and strategies to help develop and support them. You may well find that many of the ideas and strategies are useful when it comes to other forms of communication too.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication involves more than just speech. We all use gesture, body language, tone of voice, eye pointing, and so on, to support our communication. A well timed roll of the eyes can sometimes communicate a lot more than a few choice words!!! As you will see, Augmentative and Alternative Communication simply adds some extra tools into this list of existing skills, supplementing and enhancing skills that are already present.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We communicate for all sorts of reasons and to achieve all sorts of different ends. We use it to tell people what we want, to express our opinions, to direct others, to ask questions, to learn, and to feel close to others. When communication is difficult for some reason, we can end up focussing on the problems of not being able to communicate what someone wants, and lose sight of all these other things. Hopefully this resource will inspire you to think about communication in its very broadest sense.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right from the outset we can see that there is a lot of jargon about! ‘Low tech AAC’ is a pretty incomprehensible label – not a great start for something that is designed to help support communication! So time for a bit of jargon-busting…</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AAC stands for Augmentative and Alternative Communication. AAC includes strategies (e.g. signing, gesture, etc.) and equipment (e.g. a symbol chart, an alphabet chart, a simple talking button, a more complex computer based voice output communication aid, etc.) that support or replace speech.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason that there are two ‘A’s’ in AAC, rather than it just being called Alternative Communication or AC, is to make the point that AAC or Augmentative and Alternative Communication is not just for people who cannot speak at all and need an alternative. AAC is also for people whose speech is not sufficient or clear enough for everyone to understand them all of the time. In other words, AAC can augment or support someone’s speech.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AAC is often divided into <a href="#aided-aac">Aided</a> and <a href="#unaided-aac">Unaided</a> categories. Aided AAC describes any type of AAC that uses some sort of equipment, be it a pencil or a computer. Unaided AAC is communication that you do using your body with no other equipment. This basically means gesture and signing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A full discussion about signing would require another book to do it justice, but you can find out more about different signing systems and languages here:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aided AAC is then divided further into two or three categories, depending on who you speak to or what you are reading! Types of Aided AAC that you will hear about are low tech (at last!), <a href="#light-tech-communication">Light tech</a> and high tech. Some people don’t worry about the term light tech and just use low and high tech AAC. When they do this, the term high tech includes light tech. Others use the term ‘ <a href="#basic-high-tech">basic high tech</a> ’ instead of light tech.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Low tech AAC is AAC that uses some sort of simple equipment that doesn’t involve a battery. In a way it’s defined by what it is not, which is light or high tech AAC. Low tech AAC is often, although not always, made using paper. Examples of low tech AAC include <a href="#objects-of-reference">objects of reference</a> , symbol charts and books, alphabet charts, E-tran frames, etc. A better term might be ‘no tech’!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you will see, low tech AAC comes in many shapes and forms. However, broadly speaking you will find low tech AAC based around objects of reference, <a href="#symbols">symbols</a> , whole words and letters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Objects of reference are objects or things that are used to represent concepts (e.g. a plastic cup could be used to represent the concept of having a drink). Here is an object of reference that is representing a nursery classroom:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<a class="image" href="Media/images/EavHR7E.jpg"><img src="Media/images/EavHR7E-thumb.jpg" alt="Objects of Reference" width="300"></a>
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. Objects of Reference</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Objects of reference may be used to help someone remember something, to help them understand something, or to help them anticipate something that is going to happen. They can be used as a timetable to indicate what activity is coming first and what activity will happen next. An object of reference may also be used by an individual to express themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people will start their AAC journey using objects of reference and then move on to photographs, symbols, or whatever works best for them. Others will always benefit from experiencing actual objects, but may still use other resources too. Of course, some people who use AAC may never require them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CALL Scotland has produced an informative resource about objects of reference. Although aimed at schools, it’s a useful guide for anyone interested <a href="http://acecent.re/1DPC07x" class="bare">acecent.re/1DPC07x</a> . The Brighton and Hove Learning Disability Partnership Board have also produced a helpful resource about objects of reference: <a href="http://acecent.re/1aDiIX7" class="bare">acecent.re/1aDiIX7</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Symbols are special pictures that are used to represent concepts e.g. a drawing of a person drinking out of a cup is used to represent the concept of having a drink. They are used both to support understanding and to help someone express themselves. Symbol based low tech AAC is the focus of this resource. You can read more about symbols in <a href="#_chapter_3_more_about_symbols">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For individuals who are able to read, whole words and phrases can be used instead of symbols or objects to support communication. For those able to spell, alphabet charts can be used, enabling someone to generate words and phrases spontaneously. Of course, alphabet charts can be used alongside other tools at all stages to support literacy development. You can find out more about designing and using alphabet charts in <em>Getting Started with AAC: Designing and using alphabet charts</em>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>No one form of AAC is ‘better’ than another, and successful use of one form is never a prerequisite to a successful use of another. In reality, most people take a multi-modal approach, combining tools and strategies in a way that works best for them.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>AAC is used by people of all ages and abilities - from young toddlers to the elderly, from people with advanced degrees to those with learning difficulties. There are many different reasons why people need to use AAC to support or replace their speech. A person may have been born with a condition such as <a href="#cerebral-palsy">cerebral palsy</a> or a syndrome such as Down’s syndrome or Angelman syndrome, have autism or an autistic spectrum condition, have a learning disability, have difficulties with speech and language following a head injury, stroke or brain tumour, have developed a progressive neurological condition&#8230;&#8203; the list is endless. What unites this incredibly diverse group of people is the fact that their speech does not enable them to communicate in all situations or with all individuals without some extra support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AAC can be used to help people understand what is said to them, to help people express themselves, or both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AAC takes a lot of work to get started, and it takes a lot of work to develop and use over time. Stick with it… it’s worth it! Communication is what defines us and makes us who we are. It is how we make friends and develop and maintain relationships. It gets us what we want (well, some of the time anyway) and it enables us to be who we want to be.</p>

<p>Callum has learning difficulties. He isn’t able to use speech to communicate, but he can tell people what he wants and thinks by pointing to symbols.

<p>Tamsin is eleven years old and attends a mainstream primary school. When she was three, Tamsin wore two wristbands – one with a symbol for ‘yes’ on it, the other with a symbol for ‘no’, and she began to respond to simple questions by looking at the appropriate band. She also had a collection of symbols that she could eye point to. This was formalised into a full communication book which quickly contained pages and pages of symbols, and access to lots of complex language. Tamsin is able to use her symbols to play, join in with discussions in school, and tease her brother! Here she is (aged seven) playing with her younger brother.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The world of communication aid technology has come on so far in the last few years that some people question whether there is still a role for low tech (or paper-based) AAC. There is! Paper based resources are wonderfully flexible and can be used in so many different contexts. They have the great advantage of not requiring batteries, so they are always available, and with no screen to smash, they are pretty durable too. For some, paper based resources are a great back up to their high tech system (for example, when their system runs out of battery or when they are somewhere where the high tech system can’t be used - like bed or bath), and for others they are their main method of communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reality most people who use AAC communicate using a range of different approaches that includes their own mixture of low tech AAC, sounds (or some speech), gesture, signing, drawing, writing and high tech AAC. For example, someone might use their eyes to draw your attention to the box of cereal they would like you to pass them, make a sound to greet a friend, and use their high tech AAC device to have a discussion around an issue that is important to them. Beth explains this beautifully in her <a href="#movie1.1-beth">video</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Janice Light and David McNaughton are well known researchers in the field. They stress that technology in and of itself is not important – what’s important is the communication. Technology is just one tool among many that can help us to communicate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_i_know_what_my_child_wants_needs_why_do_i_need_to_bother_with_this"><a class="anchor" href="#_i_know_what_my_child_wants_needs_why_do_i_need_to_bother_with_this"></a><a class="link" href="#_i_know_what_my_child_wants_needs_why_do_i_need_to_bother_with_this">I know what my child wants / needs, why do I need to bother with this?</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As your child grows up, they will want to make friends and communicate independently. It’s just not cool to chat up a girl with your parents interpreting! The work you are doing now will lay the foundation for more independent communication in the future. It may take time, but it is important to develop good, strong foundations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don’t forget that our children can surprise us! Children come out with all sorts of unexpected things. Having insisted on eating breakfast from their digger bowl for months on end they will suddenly announce that they want the pirate bowl this morning. They share stories from school or outings that we haven’t been a part of, or just notice things that we don’t always notice. Sometimes they will want to tease us – perhaps asking for some chocolate at breakfast with a glint in their eye - just to have fun and be cheeky. We need to give them the tools to make their choices, share their stories and play with language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If everyone makes decisions on behalf of your child and never seeks their views or opinions, your child is likely to become frustrated at the very least, and, even worse, there is the danger that they will disengage and become passive. This can have huge implications for their learning and development.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_i_m_worried_that_aac_will_make_my_child_lazy_about_talking"><a class="anchor" href="#_i_m_worried_that_aac_will_make_my_child_lazy_about_talking"></a><a class="link" href="#_i_m_worried_that_aac_will_make_my_child_lazy_about_talking">I’m worried that AAC will make my child lazy about talking</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a really common anxiety. However, all the research suggests that far from holding speech back, AAC can even encourage it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, when Diane Millar, Janice Light and Ralph Schlosser analysed the literature in 2006, they found that following the introduction of AAC, no cases demonstrated a decrease in speech production, some showed no change, and most demonstrated gains in speech production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Would you regard a child who is wearing glasses to help them see as being lazy? Probably not! It’s the same with AAC. It’s a set of tools that can support someone’s language and communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For some, use of AAC will be part of their journey towards speech. Whilst speech is developing, it can underpin the development of their language and communication skills. This means that language isn’t ‘put on hold’ until speech comes, resulting in long term deficits or delays. For others, use of AAC will be part of their lives forever. Either way, putting the work in now will only help someone to be a good communicator, however this is done, in the future.</p>

<p>If you start by trying to use AAC all the time, it is likely to feel overwhelming and something that is better left until there is more time. However, as families change over time and the inevitable issues and challenges arise, the moment can never seem right for such a seemingly big undertaking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start today, but start small. Rome wasn’t built in a day! If you start small you can build on success over time. While the ultimate goal is for AAC to be integrated into the daily routine, this will take time and we all need to be realistic about this.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Making mistakes is all part of how people learn. Toddlers don’t open their mouths and start speaking perfectly formed intelligible sentences. In the same way, a person learning to use AAC is going to make mistakes and take time to learn how to use the AAC. If communication goes a bit wrong, don’t worry. Just use it as an opportunity to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes our expectations of how quickly AAC is going to work can be a bit high!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Getting started with AAC needs to be fun for everyone. In time, the use of AAC will hopefully develop into a robust communication system that can be used to talk about problems, do maths homework, and to have an argument about how much television it’s ok to watch! But in the beginning, we need to try and keep it fun and motivating. <a href="#no-fail-activities">No fail activities</a> are a great place to start.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No fail activities are activities where you can’t get anything ‘wrong’. For example, if you are playing a game where the child using AAC has to point to a set of symbols where each one tells you to do a different silly thing, there is nothing that they can get wrong. It’s a no fail activity that is just good fun. However, if you are feeling really hungry and accidentally point to the symbol of the drink rather than something to eat, this can lead to a feeling of having ‘got something wrong’ and frustration at being given the wrong thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This simple adaptation of the <em>Simon Says</em> game is an example of a no fail activity. There is no wrong selection, and whatever is chosen results in a fun and motivating outcome, or an opportunity for a nice chat together. You can always use the ‘stop’ symbol as a cue for the person doing the actions to stop in their tracks and freeze like a statue!</p>

<h3 id="choice-making"><a class="anchor" href="#choice-making"></a><a class="link" href="#choice-making">Choice Making</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Giving choices through AAC can be very empowering. For a child with a complex communication disability alongside a complex physical disability, it can be a way that they begin to take control of their environment and those around them. This is so important for learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, some children can find making choices a bit stressful. Remember that children don’t always know what they want, and that having made a definite choice, they may then change their mind. When getting started with AAC, this can lead to confusion as it may be unclear whether the child has just changed their mind (like so many do!) or has not understood the AAC system. Try not to put too much pressure on the child when presenting them with choices. It’s so easily done!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may also have evolved other ways of making choices. It might just be quicker to hold up the two flavours of crisps on offer for example, and then give your child the one that they look at or reach for. That’s ok too. Not everything has to be done through a formal AAC system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When getting started, try and keep choice making through AAC fun and light hearted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way of having fun with choice making is to ask the child to choose on behalf of someone else! Maybe they could choose what Daddy has for a snack for example. Depending on how enthusiastic (!) the person being chosen for is, you could put some funny items in amongst the options e.g. biscuit, banana, sock, with Daddy pretending to munch the sock that is chosen for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could also encourage the child to make choices for a doll or teddy. What does dolly want to eat? What does teddy want to drink?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You know your child best. When getting started with low tech AAC, it’s all about finding the things that motivate and encourage your child to begin to get to grips with this new way of communicating.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although Makaton®, PCS (Picture Communication Symbols), SymbolStix and Widgit symbols are perhaps the most commonly used, there are others available. Other sets that are sometimes seen include Bliss symbols (<a href="http://blissymbols.co.uk" class="bare">blissymbols.co.uk</a> ), Pictogram symbols (<a href="http://pictoworld.com/index.html" class="bare">pictoworld.com/index.html</a>), Clarity symbols (<a href="http://liberator.co.uk/clarity-symbols.html" class="bare">liberator.co.uk/clarity-symbols.html</a>), amongst others! There are also a number of freely available symbol sets around. A useful comparison of symbol sets can be found at: <a href="http://spectronics.com.au/article/symbol-set-comparison" class="bare">spectronics.com.au/article/symbol-set-comparison</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All symbol sets have their strengths and weaknesses, and it is worth spending time working out which set is most likely to meet the needs of your communicator and their environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When choosing a symbol set for use in a person’s low tech communication system it is important to take into account what symbols (if any) they are using elsewhere. For example, if they have a high tech communication aid or are using symbol based software or apps, you may want to aim to use the same symbols in their low tech system. It may be worth checking with staff at an early years setting, school, college, day centre, or similar environment that someone attends to find out if a symbol set is established there. If possible, it is helpful to be consistent so that someone is not having to learn multiple symbol sets. Having said that, people often end up mixing and matching to a greater or lesser degree, ‘borrowing’ missing symbols from other sets when needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whatever the symbol set, think about including the written word with the symbol to help support literacy development, and to make it easier for an unfamiliar communication partner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the symbol sets offer special symbols for people with visual difficulties. Widgit offers a set of VI symbols (<a href="http://widgit.com/products/vi/index.htm" class="bare">widgit.com/products/vi/index.htm</a>) for example, and PCS offers a set of high contrast symbols (<a href="http://mayerjohnson.com/pcs-classic-high-contrast" class="bare">mayerjohnson.com/pcs-classic-high-contrast</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that for people with complex visual difficulties, tangible or tactile symbols may be considered. These are symbols based around shapes and textures.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-not-always-easy-to-draw-a-picture-of-a-core-word"><a class="anchor" href="#it-is-not-always-easy-to-draw-a-picture-of-a-core-word"></a><a class="link" href="#it-is-not-always-easy-to-draw-a-picture-of-a-core-word">Symbols Look Hard to Learn</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People who are new to the world of symbols often worry that they look hard to learn, and feel concerned that they will be too difficult for their child.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some words or concepts are very easy to draw or represent as a picture. For example, it’s pretty easy to draw a picture of an elephant that looks like an elephant. Other words are much more difficult to draw. For example, there is no obvious picture of ‘more’ or ‘help’ or ‘finish’.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frustratingly, it is the words that don’t make pictures easily that are often the most important when we communicate. Elephants do come up in conversation occasionally, but words like more, help, and finish are ones we use every day no matter what we are talking about. They are also the sort of words that young children start using very early on, and therefore the sort of words that we want to get started with straight away using AAC. As they are so important, we tend to refer to these words as <a href="#core-words">‘core’ words</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we only make charts using the words that are easy to draw, we are seriously limiting the language development of the young person communicating through AAC. Right from the very beginning, we need to include the important core words to give children the very best chance of communicating effectively. We don’t just list objects when we talk, and it’s important that we don’t just give children using AAC charts full of the easy-to-draw objects. You will see plenty of core words in the ‘getting started charts’ included in the example charts in <a href="#chapter-5">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Research does endorse this approach. Researchers have suggested that ‘usefulness’ of the symbol is more important than how easy the picture is to learn when it comes to children learning to use the symbol. And a word like ‘more’ is certainly more useful than ‘elephant’ on a day to day basis!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help children learn to use these symbols, we need to use them ourselves as often as possible when talking to them. This is the very best way of making them easier to learn. See <a href="#chapter-8">Chapter 8, Communication Partner Skills</a>, for more information.</p>

<h3 id="make-your-own"><a class="anchor" href="#make-your-own"></a><a class="link" href="#make-your-own">How do I make resources using symbols?</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The easiest way to make a symbol based communication chart is to use specially designed software. There are a number of different software products available in the UK. One thing to look out for is what symbol set they use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples of specially designed chart making software in the UK includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Boardmaker Plus! V6 or Boardmaker Studio - available
from, e.g., <a href="http://toby-churchill.com" class="bare">toby-churchill.com</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate in Print 2- available from, e.g., <a href="http://widgit.com" class="bare">widgit.com</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix Maker Plus - available from, e.g., <a href="http://inclusive.co.uk" class="bare">inclusive.co.uk</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, if you already have software for voice output communication or symbol recording (e.g. The Grid 2, Mind Express, Communicator, Symwriter, etc.), or are intending to purchase such software, you may be able to use this to develop and print charts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes you can access chart making software through your local Speech and Language Therapy service or through a child’s educational environment. There are also a few counties that offer access to such software through their library service. You could contact your local library service to find out if this is available in your area. Some charities / nonprofit organisations also offer access to software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, just for getting started, you could make use of some of the charts we have given as examples in <a href="#chapter-5">Chapter 5</a> . All the charts shown are available to download from ACE Centre’s website (<a href="http://acecentre.org.uk" class="bare">acecentre.org.uk</a>).
To protect your charts, it may be worth considering laminating them. If you are in settings with lots of overhead lights, matt laminating pouches may make it easier for all to see the symbols. Alternatively you might want to print them using ‘indestructible’, ‘waterproof’ or ‘non-tear’ paper.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_about_photographs"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_about_photographs"></a><a class="link" href="#_what_about_photographs">What about Photographs?</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are no absolute rules about when to use photographs and when to use symbols. Photographs can be easier to learn, and may be a stage on an individual’s journey towards using symbols. For some children, however, the detail in a photograph can make it difficult to perceive the image and they may find it easier to see a symbol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Photographs can be a great way to represent specific things on a communication chart. For example, it is probably much more straightforward to use a photograph of a person (Mum, Dad, etc.) than to use a symbol to represent them. Similarly, it is likely to be much more straightforward to use a photograph of a family pet than to try to use a symbol to represent them. For some children, photographs of specific objects and people in their environment are going to be the most useful supports to their communication. For some children on the autistic spectrum, photo-based charts can also be very helpful for talking about emotions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But if you want to use describing words, or ask someone for more of something, or indeed ask them how their pet is, then photographs won’t be enough. This is where symbols really come into their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Photographs can have another role to play in communication though. They are a great way to share stories <a href="#share-stories">share stories</a> (link) about people, activities and events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However you decide to use a photograph, make sure it is a clear as possible. It is much easier to recognise a photograph of an object or a person if it is taken against a clear background rather than against a busy background like a toy shelf. This is especially important when using photographs on a communication chart, as they can end up being really quite small.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This simple example demonstrates the difference between photographing a game against the toy shelf versus on a plain background.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When creating your own charts, one of the first considerations is what words to use! This chapter takes a look at the thinking behind what words to include. Chapter 5 then provides lots of practical examples that can all be downloaded from ACE Centre’s website (<a href="http://acecentre.org.uk" class="bare">acecentre.org.uk</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When getting started with AAC, the temptation is often to focus on <a href="#choice-making">choice making</a> , but it is important to remember that communication involves so much more than just choosing or asking for things!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be useful to think about the kind of things that young speaking children say, and then ensure that people who are using symbol based AAC have a way of saying the same sort of thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This video is a good reminder of what communication is all about. Ruben’s Mum reads aloud a series of options to Ruben, and he indicates ‘yes’ when he hears the word or phrase that he wants to say. This method of accessing AAC is called auditory scanning - it is a form of <a href="#listener-mediated-scanning">listener mediated scanning</a> .</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ruben and his Mum share a special moment through Ruben’s low tech AAC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even very young children do much more than just ask for things. They will use greetings and partings like, “hello”, or, “goodbye”. They may talk about who things belong to, or who they think they should belong to! Anyone who has spent time around a toddler will be familiar with the infamous “mine” or the statement “my biscuit”. Young children may talk about the fact that there is more of something, or notice that something is happening again. They may also remark on the fact that someone or something isn’t there anymore (e.g. “Nana gone” at the end of a visit). They may talk about actions (e.g. “stop”, “eat”, “go”). They may also use their words to describe things (e.g. “messy”, “pretty”, “noisy”). Children use questions to learn about their world: “why?” may feel very familiar to some, or they may ask “where” something has gone. They may use their words to give information (e.g. “I made it”, “here’s a card”). They may also use their words to direct others (e.g. “you do it”, “Mummy help”, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These examples are far from an exhaustive list. Children can say so much! Even very young children with a relatively small vocabulary are extremely creative and have lots of different types of things to say. From Chapter 1, <a href="#watch-this-video-of-tamsin">watch this video of Tamsin</a> , aged five, telling a visitor about something unexpected that had happened to her!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As children enter an educational environment, they will also use language in more sophisticated ways. They will need to play alongside others, deal with social conflict, negotiate, plan, give opinions, reason and predict, to name but a few!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why we need to think carefully about the words we are giving to people who use symbol based AAC. A simple set of nouns (or things) won’t enable them to learn to use language in all these different ways. It simply will not suffice!</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 18. Cafe Chart</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While it is possible to ask for lots of things using this chart, e.g.:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>they could ask a cup of tea with milk and one sugar by selecting the symbols “tea milk 1 sugar”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they could ask for a biscuit “biscuit”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>they could not really use this chart to do any of the other types of communication discussed above. Indeed, once they have requested what they want to eat or drink, there is not a lot else that they can say with the chart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is another chart that contains the same vocabulary, but has just a few extra words. The extra words are ‘core’ words. These are words that would be useful whatever the situation. With just a few of these words, someone can now express themselves to a much greater degree.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As above, someone can still ask for a cup of tea, or a piece of cake. However, there is now lots more they can say. For example, they could ask if “you want cake?”, if you would like a “different cake”, or enquire if “you like the cake?”. They could tell someone that it’s, “my cake”. They could express that they “like the cake” or that they “do not like the tea”. They can tell you that there’s “no milk” or that they “do not want a biscuit”. They could get you to help them cut their cake by asking for “help”. They could draw your attention to something funny going on in the café by saying “look”. They could comment that you are eating “more cake”, or ask for “more” themselves. Then they could tell you that they have “finished”.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="core-words"><a class="anchor" href="#core-words"></a><a class="link" href="#core-words">Core Words</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When thinking about vocabulary (or words) within AAC, we tend to divide it into <a href="#core">'core'</a> words and <a href="#fringe">'fringe'</a> words.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Core words are words that are useful whatever the situation. For example, words like ‘more’, ‘help’, ‘not’, ‘like’, ‘look’, ‘go’ and ‘want’ are useful whether you are playing with bubbles, doing an art project or off on a trip to a soft play centre. Research shows that speaking toddlers rely predominantly on core words to communicate, and that a similar set of core words is used by speakers of all ages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Core words cover a wide range of grammatical forms - e.g. nouns, action words, describing words, etc. On the second café chart above, the core words are shown with a thicker border.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As discussed in Chapter 3, <a href="#it-is-not-always-easy-to-draw-a-picture-of-a-core-word">it is not always easy to draw a picture of a core word</a> . The difficulty of drawing a picture to represent such concepts as ‘more’ or ‘want’, for example, should not deter us from including these core words in communication books and charts. With the <a href="#chapter-8">right support from communication partners</a> , people can learn to use these well. Indeed with some short core words, it is arguably as easy to learn the written word as the abstract symbol. In these situations, you may just want to teach the actual word rather than the symbol. The word can be introduced and taught in the same way as the symbol would be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fringe words are the words that are more topic or situation specific. For example, words like ‘snack’, ‘spread’, ‘plate’, ‘sauce’ are useful at snack time, or if you are discussing food or planning a meal, but not so useful if you are watching TV. Fringe words tend to be much easier to draw a picture of. However, if we rely solely on fringe words when producing charts and books, we can end up with something that is very limited in its usefulness. On the café chart above, the fringe words have the thinner border, and relate specifically to the café situation - e.g. tea, coffee, milk, sugar, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Chapter 5, you will find some examples of <a href="#core-vocabulary-charts">core vocabulary charts</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an ideal world, a symbol based communication chart or book will contain a mixture of core and fringe words.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are some examples of core vocabulary lists:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gail van Tatenhove has produced some handouts on vocabulary lists – see <a href="http://vantatenhove.com/" class="bare">vantatenhove.com/</a> papers.shtml</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are various vocabulary lists here <a href="http://aac.unl.edu/vocabulary.html" class="bare">aac.unl.edu/vocabulary.html</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will also find a suggested core vocabulary in the ACE Centre guides <a href="#developing-and-supporting-a-communication">Developing and Supporting a Communication Book</a> and <a href="#look2talk">Look2Talk</a> , and core vocabulary used throughout the <a href="#PODD-Pragmatic-Organisation-Dynamic-Display">PODD</a>.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_yes_and_no"><a class="anchor" href="#_yes_and_no"></a><a class="link" href="#_yes_and_no">Yes and No</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will see that the example charts provided don’t include the symbols / words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’. This is because children often have their own preferred ways of communicating ‘yes’ and ‘no’ that do not involve the use of symbols. However, there are times when you may want to think about including ‘yes’ and ‘no’ on a chart, particularly if the child’s own method is not always clear to unfamiliar communication partners. In such cases, where a communication partner is left feeling unsure, it can be useful to have a back up way of communicating yes and no.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alongside ‘yes’ and ‘no’, it is useful for the child to have a clear way of indicating ‘I don’t know’. Sometimes the yes / no response isn’t clear because the child genuinely doesn’t know the answer, or doesn’t have a strong view. Again, if ‘I don’t know’ isn’t something the child can consistently communicate clearly, you may want to consider including such a symbol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_note_on_manners"><a class="anchor" href="#_a_note_on_manners"></a><a class="link" href="#_a_note_on_manners">A Note on Manners</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As parents, we are all keen to bring up well behaved children with good manners. Therefore having ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ on a communication chart from the very beginning can feel important. This is a very personal matter, and there are no hard and fast rules! One note of caution, however, is that when there is only limited space for words and symbols on a chart, it may be worth not including ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ at this time. They are not always the most motivating words for a child to use, and do take up quite a lot of valuable space on a chart. If you are feeling worried about leaving these words off the chart, you can always add them in yourself – for example if the child points to ‘more’ to ask for more bubbles, you could say “more please” as you blow some more bubbles, so that they are being exposed to the words.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Getting started with low tech AAC can feel daunting! This section gives you some ideas about how you might begin. It includes examples of communication charts that you can download from ACE Centre’s website (<a href="http://acecentre.org.uk" class="bare">acecentre.org.uk</a>) and use to get started. However, you will soon want to adapt these and make your own.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Getting started with low tech AAC is all about finding a way of bringing AAC into daily activities that are relevant to you and your family. It’s about finding communication opportunities that are motivating and fun.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These charts are one small step on the journey towards developing a full communication system based around symbols.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember – the charts are there to be used by you. If the child begins to join in, that’s great, but don’t force them to use the symbols. They need to become really familiar with the symbols and how to use them. That can only happen by you using them yourself as you talk to your child. You really are the key to getting started with AAC. Your skill at pointing to the symbols while talking to, and playing with, your child is what will get AAC going. You can read much more about this in <a href="#chapter-8">Chapter 8, Communication Partner Skills</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The example charts are designed to be accessed by pointing to the symbols. However, you could cut the symbols out and arrange them on an E-tran frame for <a href="#eye-pointing-communicators">eye pointing communicators</a>. You could also scan through the symbols for those using <a href="#listener-mediated-scanning">listener mediated scanning</a> , although make sure that you are consistent in the order in which you offer the symbols.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The communication charts shown below are all made using PCS symbols. However, on the ACE Centre website you can also <a href="#acecentre.org.uk/symbol-charts">download</a> the equivalent charts made with Widgit and Symbolstix symbols.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a set of words that we use across huge numbers of different situations – these are known as <a href="#core-words">‘core’ words</a> . In Section 1 of this Chapter, you will see some <a href="#core-vocabulary-charts">example core vocabulary charts</a> . Then in Section 3 of this Chapter, you will see examples of how you can design a <a href="#more-imaginative-play">chart to support a specific activity</a> . These charts all contain some core vocabulary too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the charts have examples of things you could say using the charts. This is just to give you ideas of the range of things you can say with the symbols. It is not intended to be prescriptive, and it certainly isn’t comprehensive! A few charts also have video examples illustrating their use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try and choose a chart that feels a step ahead of where you think your child is. This will enable you to demonstrate the next steps as you use the chart. It’s what we do all the time with speaking children – we repeat back what they say, adding an extra word. We are all natural language teachers! You can always blank off a few symbols if you feel there are too many, and reveal them gradually. See <a href="#chapter-8">Chapter 8</a> for more discussion around this area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you’ve all gained confidence in using a few charts like the ones below, the next step will be to begin to put together a communication book containing a wide range of core and topic vocabulary. See <a href="#chapter-9">Chapter 9</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="core-vocabulary-charts"><a class="anchor" href="#core-vocabulary-charts"></a><a class="link" href="#core-vocabulary-charts">Section 1: Core Vocabulary / Commenting</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A great way to get started with low tech AAC is to simply print off a communication chart of <a href="#core-words">core vocabulary</a> and use it whilst chatting in whatever situation you find yourself. It’s a way of commenting on what’s going on, and what your child is interested in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The great thing about a core vocabulary chart is that it’s not tied to any specific situation or event.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can incorporate simple words like ‘more’ and ‘stop’ into so many activities - e.g. for talking about watching “more television”, or observing that they are bored and want to “stop” the activity. As the charts get more extensive, you will have access to words that enable you to describe what’s going on or how the child might be feeling, offer help, ask a question, and so on.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Play is a great opportunity for language learning and development. The key is to watch what toys your child enjoys and try to bring AAC into that activity. The charts provided aim to give some ideas just to get you started.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AAC could even make some toys a lot more interesting. If your child has a physical disability alongside their communication disability, AAC may give them real control over their play for the first time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We once worked with a girl who had lots of lovely toys, including a doll. She had a doll symbol, so she could choose to play with it. But she rarely chose the doll symbol, and the doll stayed on the shelf. Instead of just having a symbol chart full of toys to choose from, we made up a communication chart all about the doll itself. It had symbols like wash, change, sleep, and bottle. Mum started to get the doll out and point to the symbols. The little girl soon joined in too. All of a sudden the doll was never on the shelf!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the help of Mum, she played and played with her doll. By pointing to the ‘change’ symbol, the little girl told Mum that her doll needed a new outfit. Together they changed her clothes. By pointing to the ‘bottle’ symbol, she told Mum that her doll was hungry. Mum helped her to hold the bottle to give her doll a feed. By pointing to the ‘sleep’ symbol, she told Mum that her doll was ready for a nap, and together they tucked her up in bed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The little girl’s doll became incredibly important to her. Everywhere that little girl went, her doll went too! Her doll even had a place at the family dinner table. By giving the little girl access to the language she needed to play with the doll, her play was enriched, and she was given the opportunity to form a close attachment to a doll just like any other young child.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section contains lots of example charts. Hopefully they will inspire you to create charts that enable your child to play more actively with toys that they particularly enjoy.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_turn_taking"><a class="anchor" href="#_turn_taking"></a><a class="link" href="#_turn_taking">Turn Taking</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of playing with toys and games involves turn taking. You could bring in a simple chart to so many activities which just enables you to talk about whose turn it is, or who should be having a turn! This personalised example allows us to talk about when it is Mummy’s turn and when it is Edward’s turn.</p>

<h4 id="_bubbles"><a class="anchor" href="#_bubbles"></a><a class="link" href="#_bubbles">Bubbles</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bubbles are popular with lots of children. Here is a simple chart that you could use to point to whilst playing together. You will notice that some of the symbols are repeated from the Core 8 chart. The repeated symbols are in the same place to keep things as consistent as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<div class="title">Figure 25. Bubbles</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even with just eight symbols, you can find a lot to say. You could say that you “like the bubbles”, agree to “blow” or “blow more”. You could say “look at the bubbles”. You could notice that the bubble has gone “pop” and comment “uh oh!”. You could talk about continuing the activity - “more” or say that the mixture is “finished” or it’s time to “stop”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here’s a simple demonstration of the chart being used.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could ask for “more bubbles” or agree to “blow more”. If the child reaches for the wand you could say that you can see they “want the bubbles”. You could comment that bubble has gone “pop” and say “uh oh!”. Or, if the bubble has floated around for ages, you could notice that it has “not gone pop”. You could notice that there are “lots of bubbles”. You could say “you catch it”. You could draw attention to bubbles “Wow! Look at the bubbles”. You could tell someone it’s time to “stop blowing – we need more mix”. You could ask a question – “I have a question. Do you like the bubbles?”. You could offer to “help blow the bubbles”. You could talk about turns – “my turn to blow” or “your turn”. If you noticed the child looking bored, you could say “time to do something different” or “let’s stop playing with bubbles”.</p>

<p>Again, there is so much you can say with this chart. You could agree to blow up “more balloons”. You could agree to “let it go” and draw attention to it whizzing around the room “look”, then comment “uh oh!” if it lands in a tricky place. You could choose a balloon and comment that you “like” the colour, or draw the child’s attention to the colour – “look a red balloon”. You could “blow more” (and more and more as the balloon gets bigger and bigger!). You could agree it’s time to “stop playing with balloons”.</p>

You could talk about how you “like” what they’ve made. Or you might “like” the colour of the chosen block. You could decide that the “tower is finished”. You could decide to “knock it down”, and comment “uh oh!”. You could agree to play some “more” or decide that it’s time to “stop playing blocks”.</p>

<p>You could talk about how you can see how much the child “likes” the doll. You could draw attention to something by saying “look, here’s some clothes we could try”, for example. You could decide to “change dolly’s clothes”, and to “change clothes again”. You could give dolly a “bath”, and comment “uh oh!” if water gets splashed in her eyes. You could agree it’s time to “stop dolly’s bath”. Once she’s dry you could give her a “bottle”. She might “like her bottle”. You could give her “more” to drink. By then it might be time to “stop” playing with dolly!</p>

Perhaps dolly is hungry and needs you to “feed dolly”, but oh dear, “dolly doesn’t like it”, perhaps we should “stop”. Maybe dolly “wants to eat something different.” Or perhaps “dolly wants her bottle”. You could discuss whether she has “finished her bottle” or whether she wants “more”. You might want to give dolly a “bath” or “change clothes”. Maybe you need some “help with changing the clothes”.

<p>You could discuss that someone would be a “good princess”. You could agree it’s time to “stop dressing up”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For slightly older child, putting on make up together might be an enjoyable form of dressing up. Here is an example chart that contains symbols from the Core 15 chart, plus lots of extra symbols related to make up.</p>

<p>Again, there’s so much you can say with just a few symbols. You could use this chart to talk about what bits of Mr or Mrs Potato Head you are going to “put on” or “take off”. You could decide to “put on a different nose” or a “funny nose”. You could say that you “want that nose”. You could comment on what Mr Potato Head looks like – “funny” or “not funny”, or talk about whether or not you “like” the chosen item. You could draw a child’s attention to some other options, “look, there are more eyes to choose from”. You could offer to help, “I’ll help”. You could say “uh oh!” if something falls off or lands on the floor. You could ask a question e.g. “I have a question. Do you like his nose?” You could decide to play with Mr Potato Head “again”, or to “stop” playing with him.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imaginative play describes play where children are using role play and pretending. Imaginative play is a great way for children to learn about the world, and to experience some control over it. Imaginative play begins by being very like real life, but as children grow and develop, it may become more creative and take on more of a story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of the play described in Section 2, Playing with Toys, is of course imaginative. This section is just offering some further examples, where the story telling element of the play is stronger. You might be playing with a dolls’ house and creating an imaginary life for all the inhabitants, or going on a pretend train journey, or acting out more of a story whilst dressing up as the different characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tea parties are popular forms of imaginative play for young children. A tea party mimics what goes on in the home, but puts the child in control. You can use pretend or real cups and food – whatever suits.</p>

<p>Doctors and nurses can be a great opportunity to bring in a communication chart. If you have a medical kit, the child can use the chart to indicate where to stick plasters or bandages. They can instruct you to take medicine – yuck! If someone was very ill, you could use a toy phone to call an ambulance, complete with siren noises. You could introduce the concept of ‘pain’ within this play, which could later come in useful when making a communication book page around problems or illness. Here is an example chart that contains the symbols from the Core 15 chart.</p>

<p>A lot of fun can be had in getting other people to do silly things. You could play a simple version of Simon Says, where you have to do whatever action the child points to. Include actions that your child can either join in with or finds especially funny! This is a great activity to do with siblings or friends. As always, you will need to model how to use the chart by using it yourself and then doing the action, before expecting that they join in. Here is a very simple chart that contains some of the symbols from the Core 8 chart.</p>

<p>You can even use symbols in the playground. Just the simple more and stop <a href="#gallery-5.1">Core 2 chart</a> above could be useful. While pushing your child on the swing for example, you could pause and see if they want “more” swinging or to “stop” swinging. You can then use this as an opportunity to model the meaning of more and stop. If you try and take them off the swing and they struggle against it, for example, you could simply say, “you are telling me more swinging” while pointing to the symbol, and carry on pushing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reading stories together has so many benefits. As well as just being a nice thing to do together, it really does underpin literacy development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Did you know that young children often choose to re-read the same story many, many times? And that through this repetition, they are actually doing some really important learning? If we are in charge of choosing it’s all too easy to pick a new story each night. As adults we enjoy variety, and our natural inclination is to read something new. Rather than reaching for something different every night, try and make a point of re-reading stories that your child has enjoyed. It will give you lots of chances to practise your use of AAC alongside the book too!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you were feeling creative, you could make your own story book using personalised photographs. You could print off some pictures and stick them into an exercise book and then write some simple text under the photograph. For example, you could make up a book about the people in the child’s life and simply write under each picture the name of the person in the photograph followed by “loves me” e.g. “Nana loves me”. On the last page you could stick a photograph of the child and write something like “everybody loves me”. Or you could make up a short book about an outing, a birthday or a holiday. You can do the same sort of thing using one of the photo album / photo printing websites, or even an app .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an example of a chart that could be used to talk about any book you are reading, whether a homemade one, an old favourite from the bookshelf, or a new read from the library.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 43. Talking about Books</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this chart you could talk about any book. For example, you could discuss who is going to “turn the page” or who is going to choose the story - “I” or “you”. You could offer to “help” the child if they are struggling to lift a flap, for example, or turn the page. You could draw the child’s attention to something on the page “look”, and comment “wow!” or “uh oh!”. You could comment that the “book is finished” and agree to “read the book again” or decide to choose a “different book”. You could talk about how you “like” or “don’t like” something in the story, or the book itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might also want to make up a chart to use with a specific book. This is worth doing if it’s a well worn favourite, although making charts for every book on the shelf is probably a bit unrealistic. That’s why a generic reading chart is so useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an example of a chart designed to be used specifically with the story Dear Zoo by Rod Campbell. It incorporates the symbols from the Core 15 chart.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another fun activity can involve creating stories. You could make up a chart, or a series of charts, that a child could use to make up their own stories, or ‘fill in the gaps’ from a range of choices. You could even go on to use symbol based word processing software (e.g. Symwriter from Widgit <a href="http://www.widgit.com" class="bare">www.widgit.com</a>) to ‘publish’ the story! Alternatively, you could just write it out on a piece of paper and re-read it together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here’s an example of a simple chart that would enable you to create some fun stories. Your child might be extra motivated to create stories involving family members or characters from a favourite television program or storybook.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Television is a part of many people’s daily life, and it can be both useful and enjoyable. If there is a quiet moment while your child is watching television, perhaps you could join them for a couple of minutes and chat about what they are watching.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a chart to chat about the television program Peppa Pig. It contains all the symbols from the Core 8 chart. Note that due to copyright issues, it doesn’t contain photographs of the actual characters, but if you were making this chart for yourself you could add them in from the Internet. For those of you that don’t know Peppa Pig(!), it’s a story about a family of Pigs called Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig, Peppa and George. There are lots of other families who come into the stories, all based around animals. The stories are very simple, but tend to involve the odd gentle mishap. While you could make a chart that was much more complicated, just these words would give you plenty to talk about during any episode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s a lot you can talk about. For example, you could say “Look!, there’s Peppa” or “Look, Mummy Pig.” If something has gone wrong you could say, “Uh oh!”. In many episodes you might find yourself commenting, “Daddy Pig is funny” or “funny Peppa”. You could notice that “Mummy Pig is happy” or that “George is sad”. Perhaps you, “don’t like George feeling sad”. If your child had a favourite character, you could easily add them onto the chart. For example, if they really liked Danny Dog, you could have him on the chart. It would then be a great opportunity to spot him during any episodes by saying, “Look! Danny Dog”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, if your child likes watching lots of different programmes, why not use a chatting chart alongside any programme. Here is an example. It contains all the symbols from the Core 8 chart.</p>

<p>A simple alphabet chart could be used to write ‘nonsense’ words – perhaps writing a pretend shopping list as part of a game. You could also blank off lots of letters, leaving just those of the child’s name, and practise spelling their name together. This gives great exposure to letter sounds and phonics, and experience in combining letters together. For this reason, it’s a good idea to include an alphabet chart in any symbol based communication book that you make.</p>

<p>There is a lot to think about when designing a communication chart. Trial and error is an important part of the process. It is helpful to make careful observations about what seems to work and what does not, and to modify your chart design accordingly. As a general rule, try and involve the individual who will be using the chart in its design as much as is possible.</p>

<h3 id="_labels"><a class="anchor" href="#_labels"></a><a class="link" href="#_labels">Labels</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where to put the symbol’s label, and how big to make the writing, is worth a bit of thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The label can appear above or below the symbol, or even alongside it.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 56. Hello Label</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The decision on where to put the label will be influenced by how someone selects the symbols on the chart. As the apple example below demonstrates, if someone is pointing to a symbol using a finger or fist, their hand may obscure a text label that is below a symbol. This can make things harder for the communication partner. Of course, if many of the communication partners are not literate (for example peers who cannot yet read), then you will also want to make sure that they have a clear view of the symbol that is being selected.</p>

<p>When creating a communication chart or book it is helpful to be as consistent as possible in your layouts. This enables people to use their motor learning when selecting symbols.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do you remember the first time you tried to use a QWERTY keyboard? It seemed to take forever to find a letter, whereas after a while you find your fingers automatically moving towards a letter without too much thought. Moving symbols around all the time can mean that approaching a communication chart is a bit like approaching a keyboard layout for the first time, every time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we are always changing the location of symbols on communication charts, we are making it more difficult for people to make use of their <a href="#automaticity">Automaticity</a> to make selections. By contrast, if when designing a chart, we always put ‘more’ in the top left hand corner, someone can begin to learn it is there and their hand can begin to travel towards it without them having to give it too much thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another thing that can help with motor learning is to plan for the future when designing a communication chart. If you feel that someone can only cope with ten symbols for now, but that you would like to move them on in due course, one option is to create a chart with ten cells now, and then a chart with</p>

<p>Sometimes people choose to colour the background of the box containing the symbol (the <a href="#cell">Cell</a>). One option is to use a colour coded system related to whether the word is a noun, verb, adjective etc. Examples of such systems include the <a href="#fitzgerald-key">Fitzgerald key</a> or the system devised by Goossens, Elder &amp; Crain (see below). Others just use colour to visually separate out areas on the page without worrying overly much about the grammar side of things. In this example, a busy set of symbols is separated out using blocks of background colour. For some, colour can help to make the symbol stand out on a page. Use of high contrast colours like yellow and black or blue and black can help some people to see the symbol more clearly.</p>

<p>Although some people may feel that using lots of colours makes the chart look nicer and more attractive, colour is not for everyone. Sometimes a coloured background can get in the way of someone seeing the symbol and / or its label clearly. A really strong background colour can actually make it quite difficult to see the black line surrounding the symbol. As with background pictures, some children will find the colour a distraction rather than a help.</p>

<p>The Fitzgerald key was developed by Edith Fitzgerald in the 1920s to help teach grammar to individuals with a hearing impairment. The key assigns a colour to different parts of speech. The modified Fitzgerald key has been used in the AAC community to highlight the grammatical function of a symbol e.g. verb, noun, adjective, etc. Typically either the border of the symbol will be coloured or the background colour of the cell containing the symbol will be coloured.</p>

<p>Sometimes pointing to symbols can be made easier by changing the size of the symbols used and the number of symbols on a page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Increasing the amount of space between each symbol can also help when someone finds it difficult to clearly point to one item. For example, here are two versions of a chart for playing with balloons. It’s not a big change, but the second example has more space between the cells. This could make it easier for someone who is using their whole hand to select, for example, or who finds targeting difficult.</p>

<p>You may need to help your child to learn that one finger is in charge of ‘pointing’. Sometimes a sticker or some sparkly nail varnish on the pointing fingernail can help. For children who are comfortable wearing gloves, cutting the end off the pointing finger of an old glove can also work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other things that may help include placing the chart or book on an angled wedge like a writing slope, or securing it on a surface with a sticky fixer like Blu Tack. It’s amazing how much easier it is to point to something that isn’t sliding around!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that some children use a slightly different form of pointing system based on exchange. The most well known form of exchange is called <a href="#pecs">PECS</a> or <a href="#pecs">Picture Exchange Communication System</a> . This is a scheme which teaches people on the autistic spectrum the purpose of communication by requiring them to physically exchange a symbol with a communication partner. The symbols are secured in book with Velcro™, pulled off and given to a communication partner. Later on in the scheme, the symbols are pulled off, placed on a sentence strip, and then the sentence strip is given to a communication partner. You can find out more here <a href="http://pecs-unitedkingdom.com/" class="bare">pecs-unitedkingdom.com/</a>.</p>

<p>For children who aren’t able to point with their fingers or hands, pointing to symbols with their eyes can be a solution to consider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Symbols can be placed on an E-tran frame like in the example below. An E-tran frame (or eye-transfer frame) is simply a perspex rectangle with a central window. The frame is held between the child and the communication partner and they make eye contact through the window in the centre of the frame. The child then looks at the symbol that they would like to select. As the frame is transparent, it makes it easier to follow where the child is looking.</p>

<p>It is sometimes difficult to work out when the child is looking around, and when they are purposefully eye pointing to a symbol. One strategy that can help is to encourage them to look back at you once they have made a selection. Angus demonstrates this in the video.</p>

<p>With listener mediated scanning (sometimes called partner assisted scanning), the communication partner points to each symbol in turn on the page, speaking aloud its label in a calm and neutral voice.

<p>When we talk about a communication partner we mean ‘you’! A communication partner is anyone with whom the person who uses AAC communicates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication is a two way process - it is not all about the person who uses AAC. When introducing AAC, of course the child needs to learn a lot, but so too does the communication partner! The communication partner has a huge role to play in the success or otherwise of an AAC system. Where someone does not have skilled communication partners, it can be much, much harder for them to really get going with symbol based AAC.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important communication partner skill that you can learn is <a href="#point-taking">point talking</a> or <a href="#point-taking">modelling</a> . This is where you point to symbols while you talk. You are modelling how it’s done!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine what a challenge it would be if you were asked to speak French before you had ever heard French spoken yourself! Yet this is equivalent to the challenge we are setting children and adults who use symbol based AAC when we hand over a chart full of symbols and expect them to use it without ever having seen anyone else use one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Babies and toddlers are surrounded by speech long before they start using it themselves. They learn the words through them being spoken around them, and they learn the power of speech through seeing what it achieves. We need to give people who used symbol based AAC some of the same opportunities. We need to surround them with symbols, and use them ourselves when we talk to them. In this way they can learn what the symbols mean, and what they can achieve. They can see that we value symbols as we take the time to use them ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The great news is that it’s not hard to do – it is far easier than learning to speak another language. You don’t even need to learn the symbols as you can just use the text labels.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Point talking is a long term undertaking. Please don’t be disheartened if your child doesn’t start joining in straight away. It is going to take time for them to learn what communicating through symbols is all about. Forcing them to point to symbols will only put them off. Just keep using the symbols yourself and showing them how much fun communicating with symbols can be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember the <a href="#five-minute-challenge">five minute challenge</a> . If you set out to point to symbols all day every day it will probably feel like too big an undertaking. One way to get going is by trying to find five minutes of focused time each day.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When point talking, it is particularly powerful if you are commenting on something the child is doing or engaged by. Rather than rushing in, watch what the child is doing, and follow their lead. For example, if they are watching a television programme and laughing, you could comment, “You like this”, while pointing to a ‘like’ symbol. For another example, if they are playing with a doll and looking at the pushchair, you could comment, “you want the pushchair” while pointing to ‘want’, and then go and get it for them.</p>

<p>Waiting is a very powerful communication partner skill. After you’ve done some point talking, you pause and give the child time to contribute. It can feel a bit unnatural, and you may find it easier if you silently count to, say, 5. You can signal to the child that you expect them to respond using your body language, perhaps looking at them and at the chart. It’s also important to wait and take your time as it can take children a little longer to get their thoughts and movements together to make a contribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don’t be disheartened if they don’t join in straight away; just carry on point talking yourself.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When parents and carers talk to young children, instinctively they tend to keep their speech simple and ‘one step ahead’ of that of the child. We can use similar skills to support the language development of symbol users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try and keep your sentences short and simple, and don’t point to too many symbols at once.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help a child who is beginning to use symbols to move on, you can repeat back what they have said, expanding on what they have pointed to. For example, if a child points to ‘more’ on a train play chart to ask for another train, you could respond, “you’re asking for more trains”, while pointing to ‘more’ and ‘train’ – and then, of course, give them the train they have asked for! You have both responded to their request, and modelled how they could develop it further.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a child is managing to do something as complicated as communicate through symbols, we need to value every communication from them, and respond to it. That’s not to say that we have to hand over a piece of chocolate every time they point to the chocolate symbol!!! However, it is important to acknowledge that they have asked for chocolate and explain that it is not possible now. Try not to ignore anything that is communicated, even if it seems a bit odd or inconvenient.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communicating using symbols is hard work and not as straightforward as talking. Children need to understand that it’s worth the effort. Try and introduce AAC into contexts where it gives children real control over their play or people in their world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Children need to experience success with their symbol based AAC. They need to have lots of positive experiences to help them see that it is worth the effort. An incredibly important communication partner skill is to support them in their communication so that it is fun and positive. The resources in <a href="#chapter-5">Chapter 5</a> may give you some ideas that you can adapt to meet the needs of your child.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may need to create opportunities where AAC has maximum impact. For example, with some forward planning, a child could use AAC to tell their classmates what action to do in a PE class.</p>

<h3 id="_confirmation_and_praise"><a class="anchor" href="#_confirmation_and_praise"></a><a class="link" href="#_confirmation_and_praise">Confirmation and Praise</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be helpful to confirm to the child what you are responding to and why. Describe what they are doing to give them feedback. For example, “You looked up to say ‘yes’ that’s the one I want. Let’s go and get it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also incorporate praise into your feedback – it’s not easy talking through symbols and children needs lots of encouragement. For example, “You pointed to the train symbol! Great talking! Here’s the train.” For example, “You pointed to the more symbol to ask for more television – well done.” Find language that feels comfortable for you. It doesn’t all have to be about superlatives – the greats, the goods, the bests(!) – it’s just about showing the child that you are noticing that they are using symbols and that you value what they are doing. Describing what they are doing within your praise can really emphasise to the child the behaviour that you want to encourage. Such descriptive praise can be a great tool for encouraging more of the same behaviour.</p>

<h3 id="_self_talk"><a class="anchor" href="#_self_talk"></a><a class="link" href="#_self_talk">Self Talk</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using AAC requires a lot of problem solving and complex skills. As you are using the AAC, try and speak aloud some of the thinking you are doing in your head – your self talk. It’s a bit like providing a commentary on what you’re thinking and doing. This will help the child learn. You might say for example, “I want to ask you about your brother. I think I’d better go to your people page.” Or perhaps, “I’ve had enough singing for today, I’m pointing to ‘stop’ to tell you it’s time to stop singing.” Or, “Its nearly tea time. I could go to your feelings page to tell you that I’m hungry!”. Or, “Your drawing is lovely – I’m pointing to ‘like’ to tell you that I like it”.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At school, and even outside of formal educational environments, people often feel the need to test the abilities of people who communicate using AAC. Of course there is a place for test and assessments. However, it is important that we don’t make every communicative interaction a test.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the ways in which people are tempted to test children is to move their symbols around to see if they can still find them. This is a bit like someone coming along and moving all the keys around on your computer keyboard and then asking you to show them what you can do! <a href="#consistency">Consistent</a> locations are so important. If you want someone to tell you how many lions they can see in the picture, do it using their familiar numbers chart - don’t jumble them up!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Children can be very sensitive to our views and opinions. Try and stay positive about the system and avoid negative comments. By modelling and using the system yourself, you will already be showing the individual how important you think their communication system is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we are making negative comments about the symbols or chart in front of them, they are likely to pick up on this. Its so easy to slip into the habit of rubbishing the chart or book if something is missing or it hasn’t word. Try very hard to bite your lip and vent your frustrations later! If you spot a problem, try and note it down (perhaps on the back of the chart for convenience) and come back to it later. The child needs to think that we feel that their communication materials are fantastic. They need to feel that we value the tools that they are using to communicate. Too much negativity around their method of communicating may lead them to switch off and reject it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you and your child become more confident communicators through AAC, you can begin to extend your skills further.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A useful skill to learn is to ‘sum up’ an activity using symbols. If you have a chart in front of you, and you have just finished an activity, you can describe what you did together, pointing to relevant symbols as you go. For example, “first we got dolly dressed, then you gave her a kiss, then we gave her some breakfast. It was fun.” This sort of repetition is a great way to support learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Observing, waiting and commenting on what the child is doing will always remain important skills. However, as both of your communication skills with AAC develop, you can begin to encourage more communication through symbols by questioning and encouraging the child to clarify what they have said by supplying further information.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many of these ideas are drawn from the Communication Matters resource Speaking with Someone Who Uses AAC. You can read the leaflet here <a href="http://acecent.re/25fEFEi" class="bare">acecent.re/25fEFEi</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you can, choose a place to talk that is quiet with as few background distractions as possible. Try and face the person you are talking to, as this will help you read their body language and facial expressions. Note though that sometimes children with a visual difficulty will find it easier if you stand on one side or another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that communicating using AAC takes more time than communicating using speech. Try and relax. Accept that there will be quiet moments in the conversation and don’t rush to fill these with more questions. This is a sure fire route to confusion as you may then end up in a muddle as to which question the answer relates to!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep your own language simple. But don’t fall into the trap of just asking questions that someone can answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to - this makes for a rather boring conversation for both parties! Try to just introduce one topic of conversation at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Misunderstandings can happen in all conversations, but do tend to occur more frequently in conversations involving AAC. Don’t worry about it. In the <a href="#PODD-Pragmatic-Organisation-Dynamic-Display">PODD</a> , they make use of a great symbol called ‘Oops’ on every page. If something has gone wrong, the child or communication partner simply points to this to communicate that there’s a problem. It means everyone can acknowledge and be transparent about mistakes.
If one or both of you seems confused say so, and try to get to the bottom of it. If you are really lost, you could see if the following questions helped get things back on track:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who are we talking about?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What situation are we talking about?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it something that happened in the present, the past or has yet to take place?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we think about communication partners, we tend to think of the adults around the child. However, there is another type of communication partner who may be forgotten about – siblings!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some siblings love to be got involved in supporting the child who uses AAC and relish the challenge of learning how to point-talk. If they are very young, they can learn how to communicate using AAC alongside learning to talk. This can only enhance their own communication skills.
Similarly, peers such as school friends, play mates etc., can be enthusiastic and motivating communication partners.</p>

<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">In this chapter:</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Think about how to develop a communication book</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find out about commercially available resources that can help</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider integrating a little voice output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the role of photo stories and remnant books alongside standard communication books and charts</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have discovered the power of communicating through symbols, the next step is to develop a communication book – a book full of the symbols that your child needs to communicate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As discussed above, this book will need to contain a mixture of <a href="#core-words">Core Words</a> and fringe vocabulary. In other words, a mixture of the useful words that are relevant whatever is being discussed, and those words that are used for specific topics or activities. Make sure that the core words are easily accessible no matter what’s being talked about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with the charts, make sure that the vocabulary stays in the same place on a page as much as possible. If ‘more’ appears on lots of pages, for example, try and make sure that it is in the same place on the page each time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be ambitious! Children have a lot to say, and a good communication book will need to contain many many pages to accommodate all the words that they need, and the words that you need to use to extend their language. You can read much more about your role in supporting communication in <a href="#chapter-8">Chapter 8, Communication Partner Skills</a> .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the vocabulary, you will also need to think about the style, layout and organisation of the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your local Speech and Language therapist may well be able to support you in developing a book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that there is no such thing as a finished communication book! They are always a work in progress and should develop and change over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having developed a communication book, make sure the child has a way of asking for it if they can’t physically get it themselves. Sometimes a communication book symbol on a wheelchair tray or arm can work well. But do remember that it is unrealistic to expect the child to take the lead from the beginning. You will need to show them the way with your communication partner skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_style_and_layout"><a class="anchor" href="#_style_and_layout"></a><a class="link" href="#_style_and_layout">Style and Layout</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes people make books in A5 files, others go for A4. You can also use Filofaxes (though printing and hole punching pages can be quite fiddly as the pages are not always a ‘standard’ size) or slip printed pages into photo pocket albums. Some companies also offer <a href="#creative-communication-book-options">creative communication book options</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try and involve the child in choosing their book. If their favourite colour is purple, then something as simple as choosing a purple file can make all the difference to how its valued. Children may want to personalise their books with stickers, pictures of TV characters / celebrities / sports stars, etc. They need to feel a real sense of ownership of, and pride in, their book.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_organisation"><a class="anchor" href="#_organisation"></a><a class="link" href="#_organisation">Organisation</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you put together a communication book, it needs to be easy for everyone to find things in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication books are often organised by topics e.g. people, food, activities, toys, etc. However, the <a href="#PODD-Pragmatic-Organisation-Dynamic-Display">PODD</a> approach uses the type of thing being talked about as a starting point e.g. ‘something’s wrong’ or ‘I want to go somewhere’ or ‘I’m asking a question’, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You don’t just need to start at the index page and go to a topic page and back again. You can also design a communication book that has links to encourage quick and easy movement between pages too. This is very much how the <a href="#PODD-Pragmatic-Organisation-Dynamic-Display">PODD</a> approach works. So for example, on a clothing page, you might also put a link to a colours page so that the person can indicate or request to quickly turn to the colours page, without first going from the clothes page to the index page and then to the colours page. Obviously this is slightly less important if the child is turning pages completely independently, but including such links can still act as a prompt to expand their conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tabs and dividers are invaluable to support moving through the pages, otherwise you can end up flicking through a lot of pages. Some people find it a help to print pages with different background colours, as it helps them to know that they are aiming for a ‘green’ food page as they are flicking through. Of course, printing solid pages of colour can be quite costly in terms of printer ink so coloured paper is another option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if you go down this route, make sure you have plenty available for ‘re-prints’ and that the symbols are still intelligible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good index page is essential. You could support this index page with symbols, and perhaps even put matching symbols on the tabs. This can really help someone to understand where their vocabulary is located and how to find it. As you can see in the <a href="#watch-this-video-of-tamsin">video</a> , Tamsin’s Mum relies on the tabs to help her move to the correct section of the book as quickly as possible. Page numbering can help too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Communication Partner Skills chapter we talked a lot about point-talking or modelling. This continues with a communication book, and you can model moving through the book by talking about what page you are turning to and why while pointing to the appropriate symbol on the index page.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we are with friends or meeting new people, we often find ourselves sharing stories about our lives. They might be stories about funny things that have happened along the way, stories about our family, stories about challenges in our life, stories that we have encountered in the media, and so on. Sharing stories is a big part of our communication, and is a significant part of how we form relationships and make friendships. It is therefore important that we make sure that people using AAC can also share their stories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can help people share their stories by giving them access to flexible vocabulary (like the mixture of core and fringe words described in <a href="#chapter-4">Chapter 4</a> and by helping them to use it well. However, you may also want to think about including photographs or photostories alongside more conventional charts or books.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the advent of smart phones and social media, many of us are now using photographs to support our communication. We share photographs of DIY projects, children / grandchildren, fun nights out, and so on. You can help people who use AAC share their stories simply by providing photographs. Or you might include text or drawings or even a leaflet from a venue or a train ticket.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What we want to do is give people the tools they need to help them share their stories.</p>

<p>This is an example of a short photostory about a child’s birthday.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The photographs immediately provide a focus for conversation. You can then extend the conversation using the child’s own words or symbols if appropriate. The photographs engage the communication partner in a way that a simple written note saying that someone had a birthday picnic at the weekend could not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can make photostories by simply printing out a few photographs and writing some labels on them. Alternatively, you might want to produce a special book using one of the photo album or photo book websites. There are also apps available that let you make personalised books on tablet devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way of supporting the sharing of stories is through the creation of a Remnant Book. It’s a bit like making a scrap book. The idea is that you collect together objects or materials that remind you of an event or experience. Remnants might include a ticket stub, dried flowers, a napkin, a brochure, anything at all really! The idea is that you include a mixture of tactile and visual resources. Looking at the book together can be a great way of sharing stories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a really rich communication tool, you could create a communication book that contained a mixture of symbols, photographs and ‘remnants’.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication passports are a way of drawing together and sharing information about how a person communicates. A communication passport can give information both about a person’s understanding and how they express themselves. They are a really helpful tool to have alongside any form of AAC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A communication passport is often a printed document. However, some people also find it helpful to have a video passport alongside the printed version. It is sometimes much easier to show someone’s ‘yes’ and ‘no’ response, and how it might vary with fatigue, for example, rather than trying to describe it in words. You may also find communication passports made as a powerpoint presentation. If someone uses a high tech communication aid, it may be worth keeping a copy of the communication passport on the device itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When developing a communication passport, it’s essential to involve the person in its development as much as possible. The individual needs to have ownership of their communication passport, particularly if it is written in ‘their’ voice. Person centred planning approaches can have a useful role to play here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an example of a communication passport. It belongs to a boy called Tiago. It is attached to his wheelchair and is kept with his low tech communication system. Tiago uses a low tech system based on letters rather than symbols, but the principle is the same.</p>
