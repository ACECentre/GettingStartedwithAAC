<p>The aim of this resource is explore access to low tech symbol based AAC when accessing standard resources is difficult physically or visually. It is aimed at people who are familiar with low tech AAC, but want to find out more about how to adjust and adapt the resources to meet individual needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a more general all round introduction to low tech symbol based AAC, you could see another resource in this AAC Information Series, <em>Getting Started with AAC: Using low tech symbol based systems with children</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this resource is all about access to symbol based resources, it is important to also provide individuals with an alphabet chart, to enable them to explore and develop their use of letters. You can find lots more information about how to design and adapt alphabet charts in the resource, <em>Getting Started with AAC: Designing and using alphabet charts</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please note that this resource is not suggesting that low tech is ‘best’, or that low tech is a prerequisite to a more high tech communication aid. It is simply about valuing the role of paper based communication systems, and sharing lots of ideas and strategies to help develop and support them. You may well find that many of the ideas and strategies are useful when it comes to other forms of communication too.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication involves more than just speech. We all use gesture, body language, tone of voice, eye pointing, and so on, to support our communication. A well timed roll of the eyes can sometimes communicate a lot more than a few choice words!!! Augmentative and Alternative Communication simply adds some extra tools into this list of existing skills, supplementing and enhancing skills that are already present.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_low_tech_aac"><a class="anchor" href="#_low_tech_aac"></a><a class="link" href="#_low_tech_aac">Low Tech AAC</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AAC stands for Augmentative and Alternative Communication. AAC includes strategies (e.g. signing, gesture, etc.) and equipment (e.g. a symbol chart, an alphabet chart, a simple talking button, a more complex computer based voice output communication aid, etc.) that support or replace speech.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason that it is Augmentative and Alternative Communication, rather than just Alternative Communication (two ‘A’s’ in AAC, rather than one) is to emphasise that AAC is not just for people who cannot speak at all and need an alternative. AAC is also for people who have speech, but whose speech is not sufficient or clear enough for everyone to understand them all of the time. In other words, AAC can augment or support someone’s speech as well as provide an alternative to speech where there is none.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Low tech AAC is AAC that uses some sort of simple equipment that doesn’t involve a battery. In a way it is defined by what it it is not, which is light or high tech AAC. It is often, although not always, made using paper. Examples of low tech AAC include objects of reference, symbol charts and books, alphabet charts, E-tran frames, etc.</p>

<p>A better term for low tech AAC might be ‘no tech’! Low tech AAC comes in many shapes and forms. However, broadly speaking you will find low tech AAC based around objects of reference, symbols, whole words and letters. The focus of this resource is on access to symbol based low tech AAC. In other words, low tech AAC that is aimed at people whose literacy levels are not sufficient to enable them to rely upon the printed word to support their face-to-face communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Light tech AAC (or basic high tech AAC) is AAC that uses simple battery powered equipment. To find out more about what’s available, see SpeechBubble (<a href="http://speechbubble.org.uk" class="bare">speechbubble.org.uk</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>High tech AAC is AAC that uses more cox§mplex equipment such as computers, tablets and iPads / iPods. High tech AAC options tend to make use of synthesised speech. To find out more about what’s available, see SpeechBubble (<a href="http://speechbubble.org.uk" class="bare">speechbubble.org.uk</a>).</p>
</div>

<p>Most of the time symbol based charts and communication books look fairly similar, and are designed to be used by someone who points to symbols to communicate alongside or instead of their speech.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>But what happens if someone can’t simply point to a symbol?</em> What if pointing is difficult, or they struggle to see the symbol? This resource is all about how to support access to low tech symbol based AAC when pointing is not easy. For information about supporting access to alphabet charts / text based low tech AAC, see the <em>Getting Started with AAC: Designing and using alphabet charts resource</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, by definition, communication involves at least two people! Sometimes the adjustments and adaptations that need to be made to facilitate access are also to do with the needs of regular communication partners, i.e. the people with whom an individual is communicating! For example, if a key communication partner in their life has a visual impairment, you may need to increase the size of font used to enable that person to see what the individual is selecting.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term direct touch describes the way someone points to symbols on a chart or page using a bit of their body. It is also known as direct selection and direct access. People most often point using a finger, but sometimes use a fist, elbow, toe, or whatever works best for them. They may also use a pointing tool to facilitate direct touch. You can never generalise when it comes to AAC(!), but on the whole, if someone can access a chart directly, this tends to be the preferred way of selecting letters (the selection method).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When designing a chart or book to meet the needs of someone who uses direct access, you need to take into account their physical and visual skills. This section looks at some of the questions you might ask when considering chart design. As a general rule, try and involve the individual who will be using the chart in its design as much as is possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>How are they going to access the chart?</em> It could be with a finger, a hand, a fist, an elbow, or some other part of their body altogether. This may affect the size of the chart, the size of the cells in the chart, and / or the amount of space between the items.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This child is using three fingers to clearly indicate their chosen symbol. You can see from this photograph that, while the chart they are using is working well, they would not yet be able to manage any more items on the page, as it would not be clear to a communication partner what was being selected.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of space is really important in chart design. Here are two versions of the same balloons chart, one with larger symbols, and the other with slightly smaller symbols with more space between them. The changes are subtle, but can make all the difference. Increasing the amount of space between cells can also help make a chart feel less cluttered visually.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>How someone accesses the chart might also affect the shape of the chart itself. While charts are often designed as a rectangular grid, chart design software is now flexible enough to be creative with shapes when needed. For example, here’s a chart that has been designed for someone who likes to rest their hand in the centre of the chart and then make small movements towards each cell.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>How far can someone reach?</em> Is it easier to access items in certain areas? If so, you will need to take this into account with your chart design and in its positioning. For example, if someone is able to access symbols everywhere on a page but finds it a little easier to touch symbols on the left hand side of a chart, you might ensure that the most useful words / symbols are on the left, and the ones that are used less often are placed on the right. Alternatively, if someone finds it easier to select symbols with their right hand, you might want to place the chart or communication book on the right hand side of their wheelchair tray.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>How many different areas can someone point to on a page?</em> As a general rule, the more vocabulary that is on a single page the better as it reduces the page turns that are required, which can help keep communication flowing. It also gives the communication partner easy access to more vocabulary to use when modelling use of the chart (see <em>Getting Started with AAC: Using low tech symbol based systems with children</em> for more information about communication partner skills).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this will need to be balanced against the physical and visual skills of the person accessing the chart. If you cannot place enough vocabulary on a single page to meet their language needs, you will need to design a system that incorporates page turns and provides ways of moving easily between pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, you might want to think about using <a href="#_chapter_5_encoding">encoding</a> to increase the amount of information on a page, or look at another access method such as <a href="#eye-pointing">Eye Pointing</a>, <a href="#coded-access">Coded Access</a>, <a href="#listener-mediated-scanning">Listener Mediated Scanning</a> or <a href="#combination-access">Combination Access</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>How well can the individual see?</em> This will impact on the symbols chosen, the size of the materials presented, the amount of material on a page, the use of colour, and how / where the chart is positioned. See <a href="#_chapter_3_visual_difficulties">Chapter 3: Visual Difficulties</a> for more information.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes an individual may need help to learn that one particular finger is in charge of ‘pointing’. Where possible, a one finger point is beneficial as it helps the communication partner to see what is being chosen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a temporary teaching tool, a sticker or some nail varnish on the fingernail of the pointing finger can help to signal to the individual (and their communication partner) what to pay attention to. Alternatively, for someone who is happy to wear a glove, you could try cutting off the end of the glove’s pointing finger.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When learning new skills, it can be a good idea to try to avoid the pressure of attempting to communicate something really important. Instead, you could practise pointing with a playbased communication chart around a game like Simon Says. There is a great reaction to whatever is pointed to, but if there are any mistakes or uncertainties, this will not result in someone being given a snack that they dislike or going on an outing that they didn’t want to go on. Try and feedback to the individual where you think they are pointing to, to further reinforce their learning.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <a href="#keyguard">keyguard</a> is a cover that fits over a keyboard or computer screen and contains holes through which keys or areas of the screen can be selected. It allows an individual to rest their hand on the cover and make selections through the holes. For some individuals it can reduce accidental selections. It can also help someone with a tremor to target an area more precisely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although keyguards are most commonly used with computer keyboards or touchscreen devices, it is possible to make a keyguard for a symbol chart or for use with pages within a book. A keyguard could be made from Perspex®, wood, or even cardboard. The downside is that there are few options commercially available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an example of a keyguard for a low tech communication chart that has been developed by Logan Technologies (<a href="http://logan-technologies.co.uk/" class="bare">logan-technologies.co.uk/</a>). They may also be able to design a keyguard to fit your own customised symbol chart.</p>

<p>Pointing tools are often designed to help people with disabilities type or make onscreen selections more accurately, but they can also help some people point more accurately to a low tech chart. They come in many different shapes and sizes. They are known by different names, including ‘typing aid’, ‘keyboard aid’, ‘touch enabling device’, ‘dibber’, ‘universal cuff’, ‘accessible stylus’ and more.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The easiest way to do this is to attach a small laser pointer to a pair of glasses. The person gently moves their head to direct the laser beam onto the symbols on a chart. However, the laser pointer could be handheld, or attached to the body in another way.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pick up and show involves someone picking up a symbol and showing it to someone. Just occasionally, someone may find it easier to grab a symbol that is Velcroed™ to a page and pull it off than they do to point to a specific symbol on a page. Pick up and show materials can look similar to PECS® (see <a href="#_exchange">Exchange</a>) materials, but are they used quite differently in that there is no requirement to exchange the symbol. The individual merely shows the symbol to the communication partner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To keep track of symbols, and to assist with motor learning, it is helpful to ensure that the symbols are always put back in the same place. The easiest way to do this is to print two copies of a communication chart. One copy is cut up into the individual symbols, and these are laminated. The other copy is laminated without being cut up. The individual symbols are then Velcroed™ onto their corresponding symbol on the laminated communication chart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, you can see that the symbol ‘like’ has been picked up. The corresponding ‘like’ symbol on the laminate sheet is just visible.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As pick up and show resources are developed into a communication book, there can be some issues around managing the materials. It is easy to lose symbols in this system, for example, and communication books can quickly become bulky. See the section on <a href="#_exchange">Exchange</a> for more discussion around such issues.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When using a few communication charts or a full communication book, some people who are able to direct access need a bit of extra help to turn the pages. One strategy is to make use of your communication partner, and have an agreed way of indicating to them that you would like them to turn the page – perhaps a special symbol on the page, a gesture, etc. However, some people find putting spacers between each page makes it easier to turn the pages themselves (e.g. self-adhesive foam squares or craft glue dots). Others find that sticking lolly sticks (available in packs from craft shops so you don’t need to eat too many ice lollies – unless you want to!) to the back of each page helps them to flick the pages over. Laminating the pages can also help make them sturdier and easier to turn, although do bear in mind that gloss laminate can make the pages harder to see, so try to use matt pouches if possible. There are some great ideas here <a href="http://atclassroom.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/pagefluffing.html" class="bare">atclassroom.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/pagefluffing.html</a></p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_exchange"><a class="anchor" href="#_exchange"></a><a class="link" href="#_exchange">Exchange</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Exchange is a slightly different form of direct access. Exchange is a method of using low tech AAC which requires the person to hand over a symbol to their communication partner. Typically the symbols will be laminated with Velcro™ on the back, and presented either on a board or within a book. It is particularly useful for individuals who are not able to understand that pointing to symbols can be communicative. Symbols can be pulled out and arranged on a sentence strip.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most well known form of exchange is PECS® (Picture Exchange Communication System). PECS® is a communication system that has been designed to support people who have autism or who are on the autistic spectrum and need to learn the purpose of communication. It is a six stage process that is widely used in the UK.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While PECS®, and other exchange systems, can be hugely beneficial for some, there are some <a id="practical-disadvantages"></a>practical disadvantages to such systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By placing Velcro™ on the back of each symbol, it is inevitable that the communication book becomes thicker and heavier. It can also be easy to lose symbols, particularly when out and about. Unless each symbol has an identified place on the page, this approach to low tech communication can mean that the symbols move around both on a page and between pages in a communication book. This can make it harder to find a symbol, particularly for someone with a visual difficulty, and reduces opportunities for motor learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a general rule, the process of picking up the symbol takes more time than simply pointing to it. This can make the communication process slower, particularly if someone finds the act of picking up a symbol physically tricky. It can be further slowed by the additional time taken to construct a sentence and then replace each symbol in the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given these limitations, it is worth thinking carefully before introducing an exchange based communication system. For some, the process of exchange is essential to their becoming a successful communicator. For others, exchange may be a part of their journey towards being able to use a pointing based communication system in the future. For a discussion around moving on from PECS®, have a look at Gresswell and Moore’s article in the Communication Matters journal in April 2006 <a href="http://communicationmatters.org.uk/page/cmj-2006" class="bare">communicationmatters.org.uk/page/cmj-2006</a>.</p>

<p>Visual difficulties can involve problems with the mechanics of seeing (acuity), but also with the processing of visual information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Visual difficulties can have a big impact on someone’s ability to make use of a symbol based chart or communication book. Symbols and symbol charts can be busy and detailed, and visual skills play a hugely important part in learning what they mean and how to use them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reports from relevant professionals can be an invaluable source of information. A child in school may have support from an advisory teacher for vision impairment, for example. Do seek their advice on how best to present information. Visual difficulties are often poorly understood. <a href="#cortical-visual-impairment">Cortical Visual Impairment</a> can be particularly challenging to understand, as visual skills can fluctuate and change / develop over time. It’s important to document what you think someone is seeing and their visual behaviours to help you, and others, build up a clearer picture of the impact of any visual difficulties. In practice, chart design for someone with a visual difficulty is likely to involve a bit of trial and error along the way!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Christine Roman-Lantzy’s book Cortical Visual Impairment: An Approach to Assessment and Intervention may be a useful resource for anyone seeking to understand more about visual difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do bear in mind that some individuals may have undiagnosed colour blindness, particularly since screening for this is no longer standard in the UK. Although predominantly affecting boys, occasionally girls can be affected. If a person is found to be colour blind, this information can be used to adjust the colours used within a communication chart so that it is as visually accessible as possible. See <a href="http://colourblindawareness.org" class="bare">colourblindawareness.org</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, it is worth remembering that just because someone wears glasses, does not mean that they don’t have additional visual processing difficulties, so do ask questions. Also bear in mind that someone may have glasses, but choose not to wear them! In such cases it’s worth seeking to understand what that person can see without their glasses on, and then adapting the symbol and font size accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are lots of factors that can be varied to accommodate visual difficulties, including size of symbols / text, use of spacing on a page, type of symbol used, use of colour (both within symbols and on the page), shape and positioning of the chart. Ultimately, if visual access to symbols is too difficult, then an alternative strategy such as <a href="#auditory-scanning">auditory scanning</a> may be considered.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication charts and book pages are often laminated to make them more robust and easier to use. In situations where there is lots of overhead lighting, it’s well worth making use of matt laminate rather than gloss laminate pouches, as the latter reflect the overhead lighting which can cause quite a significant visual distortion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative is to print the chart or pages on so-called ‘indestructible’, tear-proof or waterproof paper.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Photographs often have a role to play in a symbol based communication system. Photographs of people, specific places, specific toys and games, etc. can be easier to recognise than a more generic symbol, for example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If photographs are being used, it is important to consider how clear they are as a badly taken photograph can actually be far harder to learn and use than a clearly drawn symbol. For example, it is much easier to recognise an object or a person from a photograph if the picture is taken against a clear / plain background as opposed to a ‘busy’ background. This is especially important when using photographs on a communication chart, as they can end up being really quite small.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This simple example highlights the difference in clarity between two photographs of the same game, one taken on a plain background, the other against a ‘busy’ toy shelf.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most symbol libraries are in full colour, although the Makaton® library is exclusively black and white. Some resource-making software will enable you to use a black and white version of a symbol. This can make the symbol cleaner, and some individuals may prefer this. For some, the colour in a symbol can be visually distracting, and they may focus on the colour, rather than the picture as a whole. Someone on the autistic spectrum, for example, might have a strong preference for, or dislike of, a specific colour that might get in the way of them using the symbol communicatively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, for some, colour is hugely useful in helping them to identify the picture. In the example below, the fact that the juice in the glass and the circular fruit next to it are coloured ‘orange’ may make it easier for someone to understand that the symbol is representing orange juice. The example below shows the colour version of a number of PCS symbols alongside their black and white counterparts.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Visual accessibility can be increased by using a high level of contrast between the background and foreground colours within a symbol cell and /or on the page itself. Commonly used high contrast combinations include yellow and black, and yellow and blue.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alongside the choice of symbols and the use of colour, you will want to give careful consideration to the layout of the chart, including how many symbols are shown at any one time, the size of these symbols and any accompanying text, and the use of space between cells (see <a href="#_chart_design_to_support_direct_touch">Chart Design to Support Direct Touch</a>).</p>

<h4 id="_positioning"><a class="anchor" href="#_positioning"></a><a class="link" href="#_positioning">Positioning</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here, it is very important to understand how someone sees things. To enable you to position materials so that visual access is optimised, you will need to think about the distance between the person and where the materials are being presented. You may also want to consider where in their visual field they see best, and present the low tech resources accordingly. Once you have determined which position is best to facilitate optimum visual access, this could be documented in <a href="#_chapter_11_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together">Communication Passports</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_consistency"><a class="anchor" href="#_consistency"></a><a class="link" href="#_consistency">Consistency</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keeping the location of symbols on a page consistent is very important, whatever the access method. It gives people the opportunity to build up the motor patterning needed to access materials using automaticity (a bit like how, when driving a car, you can change gear without having to consciously think through all the steps). Where visual difficulties are concerned, consistency of positioning is also invaluable as it means that someone does not have to visually search for an item on a familiar chart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is helpful to be consistent across different charts. For example, if ‘more’ appears on lots of charts, then ideally it should be in the same place on each chart. Similarly, it is important not to fall into the trap of testing by regularly swapping symbols around on an individual chart. Imagine how annoying (and difficult) it would be if every time you came to type on your computer keyboard, someone had swapped the letters around!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pick up and show was discussed above in <a href="#_chapter_2_direct_touch">Chapter 2: Direct Touch</a>. However, it is also a strategy that can be used to support visual access to symbols, particularly when the picking up is done by the communication partner. This can help those who have difficulties managing the visual complexity of a whole page of symbols, as they are only having to look at one symbol at a time. It can also help someone with visual field issues, as the symbol can be held in the place where it is easiest for the individual to see.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this in mind, pick up and show can be used to support <a href="#listener-mediated-scanning">Listener Mediated Scanning</a>. Individual symbols, or even strips of symbols, can be picked up and shown to an individual as the communication partner scans through the options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pick up and show can also have a real role to play in modelling for someone with a visual difficulty, or when symbols are being used to support understanding. The communication partner can pick up an individual symbol and show it to someone as they are talking, rather than simply pointing to a symbol on a page that may be harder for someone with a visual difficulty to see.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For an individual with a very significant visual impairment, you may want to consider <a href="#tangible-symbols">Tangible Symbols</a>. The term tangible symbol is sometimes used as an alternative to the term <a href="#objects-of-reference">Objects of reference</a>. In this sense it describes the fact that an object is tangible, i.e. something you can touch, and that it symbolises or stands for something else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Objects of reference are objects or things that are used to represent concepts (e.g. a plastic cup could be used to represent the concept of having a drink). Here are some examples of objects of reference:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here, a small teddy bear is being used as an object of
reference to represent the nursery classroom.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Objects of reference may be used to help someone remember something, to help them understand something, or to help them anticipate something that is going to happen. They can be used as a timetable to indicate what activity is coming first and what activity will happen next. An object of reference may also be used by an individual to express themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Objects of reference were initially developed to be used with people with complex visual impairment, but are now used more widely with people with learning disabilities who do not necessarily have any visual difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CALL Scotland has produced an informative resource about objects of reference. Although aimed at schools, it’s a useful guide for anyone interested <a href="http://acecent.re/1DPC07x" class="bare">acecent.re/1DPC07x</a>. The Brighton and Hove Learning Disability Partnership Board have also produced a helpful resource about objects of reference: <a href="http://acecent.re/1aDiIX7" class="bare">acecent.re/1aDiIX7</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the term tangible symbols is sometimes used as an alternative to the term objects of reference, it can also be used to describe much more abstract symbols. For example, you might make a communication chart about days of the week, with different textures and shapes used to convey each day. In this context, tangible symbols are also known as tactile symbols. By their very nature, such symbols are often homemade as in the personalised example below:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 38. Homemade Tangible Symbols</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way of creating custom tangible symbols is to make use of a <a href="#zyfuse-heater">Zyfuse Heater</a> (see <a href="http://zychem-ltd.co.uk" class="bare">zychem-ltd.co.uk</a>). In conjunction with special paper, this printer is designed to create tactile diagrams. The black ink swells to create a diagram that can be felt using the hands. However, we have encountered it being used to print symbols that can be felt in the same way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Tactile Library website (<a href="http://tactilelibrary.com" class="bare">tactilelibrary.com</a>) is a free library of diagrams used in the education of people who are blind and partially sighted. The website contains links to other tactile graphic image libraries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although tangible symbols are often homemade, there is a range of Tactile Symbol Cues, produced in America, that is commercially available. See <a href="http://adaptivedesign.org" class="bare">adaptivedesign.org</a> or <a href="http://acecent.re/1IRp7gv" class="bare">acecent.re/1IRp7gv</a> for more information.

<p>Note that there are also tactile alphabets available. See the RNIB website for more information <a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/" class="bare">www.rnib.org.uk/</a> braille-and-moon-tactile-codes. Logan Technologies sell a braille label maker with both six key braille and qwerty input (<a href="http://logan-technologies.co.uk/braille-label-maker" class="bare">logan-technologies.co.uk/braille-label-maker</a>).

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For individuals who are not able to point directly to symbols, but who have reasonable control of their eye movements, eye pointing can be an access option to explore.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eye pointing can simply involve a communication partner holding up two objects or symbols for the individual to look at and make a selection from. However, it can also be developed into a full and rich communication system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learning to look at an item and look back at the communication partner involves lots of different skills. Indeed, trying to pin down exactly what is involved in eye pointing in communication and setting out a classification scale is the subject of ongoing and interesting  <a href="#cite-sarjent-2013">research</a>  by a team of researchers at UCL and Great Ormond Street Hospital.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using eye pointing for communication is not necessarily something that everyone will be able to do immediately, and it is not an access method that is suitable for everyone. In order to build skills in eye pointing, you should start by using it within fun games or activities and responding to where you think the communicator is looking. By keeping it firmly within the realms of fun, you can use no-fail activities to keep things light, and avoid the frustration that can alienate an individual from learning to use this skill. This is very similar to the strategy described in the <a href="#_learning_to_point">Learning to Point</a> section above. Such play can provide an opportunity within which to ‘teach’ eye pointing skills in a fun and motivating way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If using eye pointing to purposefully communicate messages is proving too difficult for an individual for whatever reason, it may be worth thinking about another access method, such as <a href="#_chapter_7_listener_mediated_scanning">Listener mediated scanning</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way of presenting information when communicating through eye gaze is to use an E-tran frame. An E-tran (or eyetransfer) frame is a Per5.2spex® rectangle with a central window removed. The idea is that the communication partner holds the frame between themselves and the communicator, making eye contact through the central window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The central window can make it easier for the communication partner to see and follow the communicator’s eye movements. Symbols (or photographs, real objects or letters) are placed around the E-tran frame, often held on by Blu-Tack or similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A mirror image of what is shown on the E-tran frame tends to be placed on the communication partner’s side to make it easier for them to follow what is being communicated. Alternatively, as in the example below, you can simply write on the back of the symbol as this will be visible through the frame.</p>

<p>As well as being held, E-tran frames may also be placed on a stand. This gives a ‘handsfree’ option and can really work for some. However, to facilitate reading the eye pointing, the communication partner may need to double check that they are still able to make eye contact through the central ‘window’. If the frame is too low, it can be harder to read someone’s eye movements.</p>

<p>It is possible to buy a blank E-tran frame (e.g. from http:// liberator.co.uk or <a href="http://cec-ltd.co.uk" class="bare">cec-ltd.co.uk</a>). Alternatively, some glass suppliers may cut a Perspex® rectangle to your specification (make sure you ask them to round the corners!). Some online companies also offer a cut to size option for Perspex® or acrylic sheets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The strength of an E-tran frame is that you can place symbols flexibly. However, this can also be a disadvantage, as symbols can end up being put in a different place on the frame each time it is used. When symbols are regularly being presented, it is worth deciding where on the frame you will place them and then noting this on the back of the symbol. This will reduce the amount of searching for the symbol that an individual must do. Motor planning is an important part of learning, and this is really helped by consistency in presentation.</p>

<p>A cheap and easy alternative to an E-tran frame is to use a piece of A3 or A4 laminate run through the laminator empty. In this instance, gloss laminate works a bit better than matt as it is more transparent.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could create something that looks a little more like an E-tran frame using a combination of paper and laminate - but note that, in this case, matt laminate works best. Less cutting is involved as you don’t need to cut around each individual symbol, but it does give you less of a ‘window’ on the communicator’s eyes. Here’s an example of a template page set out in this way:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A collection of laminated sheets can be kept together, forming the basis of a communication book. These laminated sheets can be kept in a file or held together using rings, and then the page can be removed and shown to the individual. The advantage of this system is that the communication partner does not have to add and remove symbols from an E-tran frame each time there is a change of activity or topic of conversation. In addition, the symbols stay in the same place each time they are presented which can help with learning.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An easel file / binder is another way of presenting material for eye pointing communicators. The file ensures that material is presented at a good angle, but can be used handsfree which some people find easier. As with the laminated sheets of symbols, it can also speed communication as there is no need to attach or re-attach symbols to a frame whenever there is a new topic of conversation or activity. Easel files are available from some of the large office stationery suppliers (e.g. Viking Direct, Staples, etc.).</p>

<p>One of the first considerations when setting up an eye pointing system is how many items to present at any one time. This is a real balancing act between language and communication needs, and eye pointing ability. If there are too many options, it can be difficult for the communication partner to interpret the direction of gaze.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When symbols are presented on an E-tran frame or similar, people tend to limit the number of symbols (or groups of symbols) presented in order to limit the number of different eye pointing movements that will be required to make selections. The number presented will vary, depending upon the individual’s eye pointing skills, visual ability and their language needs, but people tend to present between 2 and 8 options at any one time.</p>

<p>When placing symbols on an E-tran frame or similar, people tend to arrange them in a landscape layout, making use of the corners of the E-tran frame, page or laminate sheet. This layout means that the individual can make selections by looking to the corners. However, some people prefer to place symbols differently. By placing four symbols in a cross, you can make selections using up / down and left / right movements for example. Others may prefer more of a zig zag shape.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the challenges of using eye pointing is differentiating between a ‘searching’ look and a ‘choosing’ look. In other words, how does the communication partner know whether someone is just searching for the symbol they want, or actually looking at the option they want?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One strategy that can work well on an E-tran frame or similar is the, ‘Look back at me’ strategy. Here, the communication partner encourages the communicator to search through the various options, then to look purposefully at the desired option when they have found it (briefly holding their gaze on it), and finally looking back at the communication partner to confirm that they have made that choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is another video demonstration of an E-tran frame in action. Watch how Angus looks around at all the symbols before fixing his gaze on ‘more’. He then makes eye contact with the communication partner to confirm that he has made a selection. He then looks around again before fixing his gaze on ‘like’, and confirming his selection by making eye contact again.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Angus looks around then fixes his gaze on a symbol. He then makes eye contact to confirm he has selected a symbol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Others prefer a strategy of looking around, making eye contact with the communication partner to signal that they are ready to make a choice, and then fixing their gaze on the target symbol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whichever strategy is chosen, it is important to make sure that all who work with the individual know and understand it. It can be useful to document how an individual makes a selection in a <a href="#_chapter_11_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together">Communication Passport</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>What if I Want to Present More Options at a Time?</em> Obviously, using such a small number of symbols (in the examples above, just 2 to 8 are shown at any one time) has significant implications for the amount of information that can be communicated without having to move between different pages / sheets or the communication partner having to quickly set up more symbols on an E-tran frame.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a larger number of symbols are needed, one way of offering them without multiple page turns / E-tran frame swap arounds is to make use of <a href="#_chapter_5_encoding">encoding</a>. Encoding enables you to select from more symbols while still using the same number of eye pointing movements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Encoding means that by eye pointing to just six different areas on a page, Tamsin (shown in the photograph below chatting with her brother) is able select from thirty-six symbols at a time. This vastly increases the amount of language that is easily accessible to her, and speeds up communication by reducing the number of page turns involved in any one sentence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Encoding is explained in detail in <a href="#_chapter_5_encoding">Chapter 5</a>, but essentially Tamsin first eye points to one of the six blocks that contains her target symbol. She then clarifies which of the six symbols within the block she would like by eye pointing to the coloured dot that matches the border colour of her target symbol.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way of presenting more options on an eye pointing array is to use an EyeLink approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An EyeLink chart is traditionally based around letters, and is designed to be held up between two people. The transparent laminate means that the communication partner can see which letter the individual is eye pointing. Whereas an E-tran frame or similar is held in position between the individual and their communication partner, with an EyeLink approach the transparent sheet is constantly being moved. The communication partner moves the sheet in the direction that the individual is eye pointing to so that they both end up looking at the same letter.</p>

<p>Here is Lisa using her EyeLink chart to introduce herself. She does not need to select every letter as her PA is able to guess what she is saying. If the PA guesses incorrectly, Lisa simply shakes her head and carries on spelling the word.</p>

<p>Although an EyeLink approach tends to be used with letters, there is no reason why symbols could not be presented in this way. If you are working with a very confident eye pointer, it may be something worth exploring.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When someone is communicating using eye pointing, make sure you give them feedback on where you think they are looking as you respond.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be helpful to make a statement (e.g. “I think you are looking here [tap the symbol] – you’re telling me ‘like’” or simply “You are looking at ‘like’”) rather than asking questions every time (e.g. “Are you looking at ‘like’?”). The individual can still respond to the statement and make it clear that you are wrong, but using a statement rather than a question takes away the feeling of someone ‘double checking’ or questioning every utterance you make.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is something about communication using eye pointing that can lead to feelings of anxiety in the communication partner. They will often check, double check and even triple check that they have correctly understood the selection. The problem with this is that it slows communication down and can lead to frustration. Can you imagine how irritating you would find it if someone asked if they had understood you correctly multiple times after every single sentence you uttered?! Many of us would quickly give up speaking under those circumstances, and the same is true of communicating through eye gaze. Try and lift the pressure a little.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way testing can be introduced into normal day-to-day conversation using eye pointing is by ‘swapping’. Communication partners are often tempted to move symbols around to see if the individual can still find them. This is a bit like someone coming along and moving all the keys around on your computer keyboard and then asking you to show them what you can do! Try and keep the location of symbols as consistent as possible to enable individuals to build confidence in their communication system.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modelling, or pointing to symbols while you talk, is a vital communication partner skill. It is how individuals learn both what symbols mean and how to use them. You will find an indepth discussion of modelling and communication partner skills more generally in the <em>Getting Started with AAC: Using low tech symbol based systems with children</em> resource.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When modelling communication through eye pointing to symbols, it can be helpful to demonstrate to an individual how you are reading their eyes, perhaps even giving them some experience of reading your own eye movements to help them understand what is involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, on a day-to-day basis, simply pointing with a finger to the symbols should be sufficient. This video shows Clare pointing to symbols in Jake’s eye pointing communication book while they play with bubbles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using an eye pointing communication book that has some sort of index page, it is worth taking the time to start at the beginning of the book so that you are modelling how to find the symbols as well as how to use them.</p>

<p>Encoding expands the amount of vocabulary available on one page by grouping vocabulary items together. The person communicating first indicates the group that they want, and then identifies the individual item within that group. This has the advantage of expanding the amount of vocabulary available on one page. The downside is that it requires two selections to communicate one item. Encoding is often supported by colour, but you can also use numbers or even textures, shapes and position.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a set of symbols that have been encoded using colours. The chart has been designed to be used by someone who is able to select from six different locations, but finds six symbols on a page too limiting for their communication. Encoding means that using six target areas, the communicator can actually say thirty-six different things without turning a page. The page is divided into six blocks of six symbols. Within each block, the symbols have different coloured borders. There are six coloured dots around the edge of the page which match these coloured borders.</p>

<p>To communicate the symbol ‘noisy’, for example, the person would first select the block of six symbols containing the symbols ‘animal’, ‘pet’, ‘wild’, ‘sweet’, ‘scary’ and ‘noisy’.

<p>Colour encoding in action. Here it is used with an alphabet chart, but the principles are the same whether it is letters, numbers or symbols that are encoded. In the video, filmed from the perspective of the communication partner, we see the mirror image of the alphabet chart that Tiago is eye pointing to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If using colour encoding with symbols, it is probably best to avoid using colour to mark the grammatical feature of the symbol (as with the <a href="#Fitzgerald-key">Fitzgerald key</a> for example) as otherwise it can become very confusing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Colour encoding is sometimes done using dots, as in the examples above, or sometimes using thick coloured borders around the blocks, as in the example below.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If, for any reason, a communicator does not want, or is unable, to use colour to support encoding, another strategy is to use numbers. This was really helpful, for example, when working with a teenage boy who felt that colour encoding looked a bit ‘babyish’.</p>

<p>How numerical encoding works (and don’t worry - the guinea pig had been fed!).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Encoding and coding can feel a bit complicated, both for the communicator and for the communication partner. It is often best to start small, perhaps using just two colours or numbers, within a fun and motivating game / activity. Once someone is confidently communicating using two colours, you can then introduce a greater range.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an example of an introductory encoded page for singing Old MacDonald. To direct someone to sing that Old MacDonald had a cow, you would first select the group containing the items ‘cow’ and ‘pig’. You would then clarify that you wanted ‘cow’ by selecting the blue dot, as ‘cow’ has a blue border.</p>

<p>As with all communication systems, the communication partner will need to model the encoding lots of times before there is any expectation of the individual making use of the strategy themselves [see <em>Getting Started with AAC: Using low tech symbol based systems with children</em> for lots more information about communication partner skills].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The communication partner should also talk about what they are selecting and why. For example, “different has a blue border so I need to find the blue dot”. Modelling or pointing talking with encoding or coding can feel strange. However, it is important to demonstrate both how to use the vocabulary and how to select it. Modelling encoding will help someone learn how it all works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this video you will see Tamsin using her encoded communication book to share information. Her mother models both how the encoding works and how to use the vocabulary in order to help Tamsin learn how to expand her story.</p>

Tamsin’s Mum then models how she could expand her story.</p>

<p>Like encoding, <a href="#coded-access">Coded access</a> is another way of increasing the amount of vocabulary that is available on a page beyond what someone is able to access directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coded access describes an access method where symbols are effectively given a grid reference that the individual then communicates. It requires two separate charts to communicate. One chart contains the symbols, the other allows the communicator to indicate the location of the symbol you wish to communicate. It’s a bit like using a map – you look up the location of a road in your street atlas and it tells you the grid reference on the page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coded access is not straightforward, and it is essential that the system is well documented - perhaps in a <a href="#_chapter_11_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together">Communication passport</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this simplified example, the first chart contains the target symbols and the second chart is used by the individual to communicate the location of the target symbol. The second chart contains colours so that the correct column can be identified, and numbers so the correct row can be identified.</p>

<p>The colours are used to indicate the column or y-axis of the target symbol, and the numbers are used to indicate the row or x-axis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coded charts can be set up in many different ways, taking into account an individual’s access abilities. The code can be as simple or as complex as is needed to suit the individual and their communication partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this more complex example, the first chart contains the target symbols and the second chart is used by the individual to indicate the code. This chart uses a three step code to identify the target symbols. The individual first indicates the quadrant that contains the target symbol by pointing to the corresponding colour, and then identifies the row number of the target and its column colour.</p>

<p>The chart that is used to communicate the location of the symbol or the code can itself be accessed in a variety of ways. For example, someone might point directly to the code, eye point to the codes on an E-tran frame (or similar), or access the codes through listener mediated scanning.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Listener mediated scanning is the term used to describe the access method whereby a communication partner delivers the options that are available by pointing to symbols or speaking aloud the words, or by a combination of both, and the communicator indicates when the communication partner has reached the desired option. Listener mediated scanning is also known as partner assisted scanning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three different types of listener mediated scanning:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Visual scanning - the communication partner simply points to symbols on offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditory scanning - the communication partner simply speaks aloud options without pointing to any symbols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual and Auditory scanning - the communication partner both points to the symbols on offer and speaks aloud their label.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For individuals who are able to see symbols, listener mediated scanning will usually involve both visual and auditory scanning, as in this simple example. However, as both parties gain confidence, it may progress to purely visual scanning over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="videoblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Visual and auditory scanning of a simple bubbles symbol chart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For individuals whose visual difficulties mean that they are unable to see symbols, purely auditory scanning may be the preferred access method. However, sometimes there is still a role for a combination of visual and auditory scanning. For example, with cortical visual impairment, visual skills can develop over time and you may want to point to symbols alongside the auditory input to help stimulate visual development. You may also want to use the <a href="#_pick_up_and_show">Pick up &amp; show</a> strategy of bringing each symbol or group of symbols into the optimum place for the individual to see them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Listener mediated scanning may be someone’s primary access method to a low tech communication chart or book. Alternatively, it may be used by someone who uses direct access some of the time, and listener mediated scanning when they are fatigued or ill.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes people will use a combination of direct access and listener mediated scanning. For example, they may point or eye point to the area on the page, and then the communication partner will scan through the options. This is known as <a href="#_chapter_8_combination_access">Combination access</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_making_a_selection"><a class="anchor" href="#_making_a_selection"></a><a class="link" href="#_making_a_selection">Making a Selection</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Listener mediated scanning is at its most clear when an individual is capable of communicating both ‘yes’ and ‘no’. However, so long as the individual has a way of communicating ‘yes’, then listener mediated scanning is viable.
There are two ways of making selections:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The individual waits until they see and / or hear the desired option and then indicates ‘yes that’s the one I want’ by an agreed movement or vocalisation, or even by activating a single message voice output communication aid that says “yes” or similar.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>or</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The individual communicates ‘no’ after each option offered (by an agreed movement or vocalisation, or even by activating a second single message voice output device) until they see and / or hear the desired option and then indicates ‘yes that’s the one I want’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantage of the first method is that it is quicker and less effortful for the individual using the system to communicate. Effectively they can sit back and relax until the desired option is seen and /or heard. However, it can mean that a desired option is missed, particularly by a listener / communication partner who is not experienced and rushes through the options or misses the agreed affirmative signal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantage of the second option is that it can be more reliable as the communication partner / listener does not move onto the next option until they have established that the individual does not want the option offered. The disadvantage is that this can make the whole process much slower and more effortful for the individual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In practice, where an individual does have a reliable way of indicating ‘yes’ and ‘no’, people often choose to get started using the second method, moving to the first method as both the individual and the communication partner gain confidence in the access method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When getting started, you might describe what the individual is doing and why you are interpreting it as yes. For example, “You are smiling to say ‘yes, that’s the one I want’”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, Ruben communicates ‘yes’ when he hears the option he wants by raising his arms and smiling. He has a large communication book full of words and phrases that he can choose from. You can see more of this here.</p>

She accesses this by means of a switch which is attached to her wheelchair. She is at the early stages of learning how this works, and the switch position is still being established. Eva and her communication partner will be working on pressing the switch with the side of her head, rather than catching it with her eye.</p>

<p>Eva is learning to use auditory scanning within a structured activity. She needs to press the switch with the side of her head to activate the message ‘yes’ when she hears the option she wants to select.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The method by which an individual indicates acceptance of an option should be clearly documented on the chart / book and in the <a href="#_chapter_11_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together">Communication passport</a> if present.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_going_through_the_options"><a class="anchor" href="#_going_through_the_options"></a><a class="link" href="#_going_through_the_options">Going Through the Options</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using auditory scanning or combined auditory and visual scanning, speak aloud all the options first so that the individual knows what’s coming and can think about their response. Then read aloud each option slowly and carefully, pausing for long enough after each option to give the individual time to respond. You may need to go through the list more than once to give the individual time to think through what they want to say.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using visual scanning, again make sure that you pause for long enough after each option to give the individual enough time to respond. Again, you may need to go through the list more than once to give the individual time to think through what they want to say.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you both become more experienced, you may not need to go through all the options first as these will be known already. You will also become more experienced at gauging the amount of time you need to pause after delivering each option. This information can then be included in the instructions and in any <a href="#_chapter_11_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together">Communication passport</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the key role that the communication partner plays in this access method, it is especially important to try and ensure that the individual has the opportunity to communicate with a consistent set of communication partners, particularly at the beginning when everyone involved is working to build confidence in the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using auditory scanning or combined auditory and visual scanning, try and read through the options using a neutral voice. Keep expression to a minimum, and use as low a volume as is appropriate to the individual and setting. When a choice is made, then say the chosen option in a more animated way. In other words, use a more social voice. You can hear the different voices in this video. Katharine reads aloud the options in a calm and quiet voice, but once a selection has been made, she reads it aloud it in a much more animated voice.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_smart_partner"><a class="anchor" href="#_smart_partner"></a><a class="link" href="#_smart_partner">Smart Partner</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The joy of a low tech scanning system (i.e. one that is delivered by a communication partner rather than a computer) is that you are so much cleverer than a computer! If you are reading through a list and there is a sudden noisy distraction, you know to pause and allow time for that to pass. If the individual is tired that day, you know to read through the options more slowly. You may also be able to spot a ‘yes’ response that is being initiated, even if it’s not quite on target due to fatigue or illness. Of course, you also benefit from not needing to be charged!!!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But sometimes partners aren’t so smart! With scanning systems it is incredibly important to ensure that all communication partners understand how to use the system and use it consistently. It is also important to ensure that all communication partners use the system in the same way. Written instructions are essential. Given the complexities, a short video may also be useful for new communication partners. A <a href="#_chapter_11_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together">Communication passport</a> can be very helpful too.</p>

<h3 id="_organising_information"><a class="anchor" href="#_organising_information"></a><a class="link" href="#_organising_information">Organising Information</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simplest way of scanning through options is to offer each option in turn. However, this can be time consuming, particularly when you are offering lots of options. To speed up the process of communication, you may want to divide the information into some sort of groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This communication chart has been grouped by highlighting rows of symbols. The idea is that you offer each row in turn before offering the individual options along the chosen row.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 75. Chart of grouped symbols</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By grouping the symbols, you can communicate options along the bottom row much more quickly than if you simply offered each symbol in turn. Without grouping, you would need to scan through 19 options to get to the symbol ‘slow’. By grouping, you first scan through 4 rows, and then 4 options to get to the symbol ‘slow’. This is a total of 8 options. Grouping really does increase the speed with which symbols can be selected, and therefore the pace of the conversation.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with <a href="#_chapter_6_coded_access">Coded access</a>, there are lots of different ways of grouping information. You might do it by quadrants, rows, or columns - whatever works best for the individual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have started grouping information, it is essential that instructions are clearly written on the chart or accompanying the communication book and in a <a href="#_chapter_11_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together">Communication passport</a> if present. It would be very confusing for an individual if options were offered inconsistently. In the example above, if one communication partner offered the information in columns while the others offered it in rows, this could cause real confusion. Such confusion and lack of consistency can be a real contributor towards individuals rejecting such systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No matter how efficiently you group information, some symbols are always going to be quicker to select than others. Bear this in mind when designing a communication chart or book that is to be accessed by listener mediated scanning, and try to put the important messages, or those that will be communicated most frequently, near the beginning of the groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Careful organisation can really speed up communication. So if, for example, we were designing an alphabet based communication chart that was to be accessed by listener mediated scanning, we would make sure that letters like ‘e’, ‘t’ and ‘a’, which are used in lots of words, were near the beginning of a group, and letters like ‘z’ and ‘q’ which are not used very often, were near the end of a group. The same principle can be applied to symbols.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is lots of information about getting started in the <em>Getting Started with AAC: Using low tech symbol based systems with children</em> resource. Systems that are set up based purely on auditory scanning with no symbols at all, tend to look and feel a bit different, but you may well find ideas and strategies here that you can adapt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are communicating with someone who needs AAC but is unable to see and / or point to symbols, auditory scanning is probably something that you do lots of times every day in an ad hoc way. This is great, but the danger with an ad hoc system is that the options presented may differ, or the same options may be presented in a different order. This can lead to insecurity, as the individual does not know that the option they want will always be presented. It also means that they have to listen extra carefully, as they don’t know where the option they want will come in the list – will it be the first item, the second, the last? Will it come at all?!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing down the options brings security. It means that the communicator and the communication partner know that something important is not going to be forgotten. It also means that the individual can begin to make use of their long term memory to learn the options on offer, rather than always having to rely on their short term memory. They don’t have to listen quite so carefully, which takes the pressure off a bit, and this familiarity will also help on those occasions when you are in a distracting environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best way to get started with auditory scanning is therefore to have a notebook and pen, and start writing down the options required in different situations. As with all AAC, try to keep things fun, particularly in the beginning. Auditory scanning is hard work. Getting started with auditory scanning needs to feel fun, rewarding and highly motivating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When writing down the options, try and avoid questions and instead write from the perspective of the individual:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rather than: Do you want a drink?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try: I want a drink</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The individual may respond ‘yes’ to the question ‘Do you want a drink?’. However, this may not be what they had wanted to say. By offering the individual a series of statements, you are offering them a voice so that they can choose what they would like to say.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start by choosing one activity, and think about the different options available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Toys – I want…</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vibrating cushion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bells</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Squishy ball</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A different toy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop playing with toys</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This doesn’t just have to be about choice making though. You could think of an activity and write down the ways an individual could engage with it.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Playing with play dough&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Roll the play dough</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an animal cutter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make an ice cream</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a pizza</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something different [useful as you may not have all the options on the list and this gives the individual a way asking for a different option]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop playing with play dough</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>With listener mediated scanning, it is important that the communication partner uses the same access method when modelling or point talking at least some of the time. This means that they should use the same process of scanning through the options to arrive at their selection. This helps to reinforce the process by which symbols are selected, and also helps the individual to learn the routes to the different symbols within their communication chart or book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no getting away from the fact that using listener mediated scanning yourself when chatting feels very odd indeed, particularly when it’s purely auditory scanning and there are no symbols for you to point to. However, there is no better way to help someone become fluent in their language. Its also a very good reminder of the challenges the individual is facing in trying to use this system to communicate! A great way to get started is to practise with a friend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here’s an example of how you might model a simple auditory scan book:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“I want to ask you something. Let’s look in your book. Here are my options: Food, Drink, Toys, Chat&#8230;&#8203; Yes! I’ll turn to the Chat page. Here are my options: Hello, How are you?, Did you have a good weekend? Yes! Did you have a good weekend?”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could also set up a situation with another individual. For example:
“I’m feeling thirsty. I’ll ask Nana if she will get me a drink. Let’s look in the book. Here are my options: Food, Drink… Yes! I’ll turn to the Drink page. Here are my options: Water, orange squash, apple juice… Yes! Apple juice. I would like some apple juice. Nana, please could you get me some apple juice?”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the individual has a full communication book, try and start from the beginning of the book when modelling. This will help the individual learn how to find their way around their book. If they have a way of gaining attention or of indicating that they want to communicate using their book, you could start with that too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a video of Karen demonstrating how you could model using an auditory scan communication book. The book has been designed based on the principles of <a href="#PODD">PODD</a>.</p>

<p>Rather than just announcing, “ we’re going for a walk”, Karen uses the child’s communication book to communicate this.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Combination access means using more than one access method within a system. Some people combine access methods within one system. For example, an individual might eye point or point with their hand to a group of symbols, and then use listener mediated scanning to select the specific symbol. For another example, as shown <a href="#double-encoded-example">above</a>, an individual might eye point or point with their hand to a group of symbols and then use a code to select a specific symbol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following chart has been designed to facilitate a combination of access methods. The individual directly selects one of four areas on the page, and the communication partner then scans through the options within the selected area.</p>

<p>Here, someone is able to point to one of four areas on the page using their fist. The communication partner then scans through the options within the selected area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people also use a combination of different access methods over the course of a day or in different environments. For example, someone might point directly to a communication book during the day, but switch to listener mediated scanning when they are fatigued or unwell. This is entirely legitimate but needs to be well documented. It may also affect the design of the resources. You will need to ensure that the resources can either accommodate both access methods, or, if you are using separate ones, that all the resources are as consistent as possible. Information about this should be well documented, ideally in a <a href="#_chapter_11_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together">Communication passport</a>.</p>

<p>“<a href="#facilitated-communication">Facilitated-communication-(FC)</a> or Facilitated Communication Training (FCT) as described by Rosemary Crossley, who is credited with being the originator, is a technique in which physical, communication, and emotional support is provided by a facilitator to an individual with a communication disorder (communicator). With assistance, the communicator points to symbols such as letters, pictures and/or objects.” American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA). The assistance often consists of providing backward resistance for the communicator to push against creating a steadying effect so that they can accurately point to their target.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the physical input of another person into the construction of the message, there have been anxieties concerning the integrity of this access method. The International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ISAAC) released a position statement in July 2014 stating that they do not support FC as a valid form of AAC or a valid access method. This position statement was produced after a committee of researchers carried out a literature review of research that examined who was actually composing the message, and the discussions of the committee were confined to this aspect of FC/FCT.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CandLE is a national AAC organisation that has a lot of expertise in this area. CandLE has developed an alternative approach called Motor Planning Training (MPT). No claims are made in relation to authorship, which are the grounds upon which ISAAC dismissed the FC/FCT approach.

<li>
<p>Think about how to develop a communication book</p>

<li>
<p>Find out about commercially available resources that can help</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have established a suitable access method and begun to develop some resources, the next step is to develop a communication book – a book full of the symbols / statements that an individual needs to communicate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think carefully about the vocabulary within the book. Communication is about so much more than just making choices, and a communication book needs to reflect this. You can find out much more about vocabulary selection within the <em>Getting Started with AAC: Using low tech symbol based systems with children</em> resource.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To facilitate learning, make sure that the vocabulary stays in the same place or position on a page as much as possible. If ‘more’ appears on lots of pages, for example, try to make sure that it is in the same place on the page / position in the list each time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be ambitious! Even very young children have a lot to say, and a good communication book will need to contain many, many pages to accommodate all the words that they need, and the words that you need to use to extend their language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the vocabulary, you will also need to think about the style, layout and organisation of the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your local Speech and Language Therapist may well be able to support you in developing a book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that there is no such thing as a finished communication book! They are always a work in progress and should develop and change over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure someone has a way of asking for their communication book if they can’t physically get it themselves. A communication book symbol on a wheelchair tray or arm can work well. Some enjoy using a single message voice output device to say something like, “I’ve got something to say, please get out my communication book”. But do remember that it is unrealistic to expect an individual to take the lead from the beginning. You will need to encourage their use of their communication book by example, by getting the book out yourself and using it as much as possible to support your communication with them.</p>

<p>Sometimes people make books in A5 files, others go for A4. For <a href="#_chapter_4_eye_pointing">eye pointing</a> and <a href="#_pick_up_and_show">Pick Up and Show</a>, an <a href="#_easel_file">Easel File</a> may be useful. You can also use Filofaxes (though printing and hole punching pages can be quite fiddly as the pages are not always a ‘standard’ size) or slip printed pages into photo pocket albums. If being used alongside <a href="#_e_tran_frame">E-tran Frame</a>, a communication book may be more about effective storage, as in the earlier example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try and involve the individual in choosing their book. If their favourite colour is purple, then something as simple as choosing a purple file can make all the difference to how it is valued. Individuals may want to personalise their books with stickers, pictures of TV characters / celebrities / sports stars, etc. They need to feel a real sense of ownership of, and pride in, their book.</p>

<h3 id="_organisation"><a class="anchor" href="#_organisation"></a><a class="link" href="#_organisation">Organisation</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you put together a communication book, it needs to be easy for everyone to find things in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication books are often organised by topics - e.g. people, food, activities, toys, etc. However, the <a href="#PODD">PODD</a> approach uses the type of thing being talked about as a starting point - e.g. ‘something’s wrong’, or ‘I want to go somewhere’, or ‘I’m asking a question’, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is not always necessary to start at the index page and go to a topic page and back again. You can also design a communication book that has links to encourage quick and easy movement between pages too. This is particularly important where access is not so straightforward. For example, on a ‘Clothes page’, you could put a link to a ‘Colours page’ so that the communicator can indicate or request to quickly turn to the ‘Colours page’, without first going from the ‘Clothes page’ to the index page and then to the ‘Colours page’. This is very much how the <a href="#PODD">PODD</a> approach works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good index page is essential. You could support this index page with symbols, and perhaps even put matching symbols on the tabs. This can really help someone to understand where their vocabulary is located and how to find it. Tabs and dividers are invaluable to support moving through the pages, otherwise you can end up having to flick through a lot of pages. As you can see in the video, Tamsin’s mum relies on the tabs to help her move to the correct section of the book as quickly as possible. Page numbering can help too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people find it useful to print pages with different background colours as it helps them to know that they are aiming for a ‘green’ page, for example. Printing solid pages of colour can be quite costly in terms of printer ink, of course, and a cheaper option may be to use coloured paper. However, if you go down this route, make sure you have plenty of coloured paper available for ‘re-prints’ and that the symbols are still intelligible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With any communication book it is important to model how to move / navigate through the book. To do this, talk about what page you are turning to, and why, while pointing to the appropriate symbol on the index page.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The easiest way to make a symbol based communication book is to use specially designed software. There are a number of different software products available in the UK.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples of specially designed chart making software in the UK includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Boardmaker Plus! V6 or Boardmaker Studio - available from, e.g., <a href="http://toby-churchill.com" class="bare">toby-churchill.com</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, if you already have software for voice output communication or symbol recording (e.g. The Grid 2, Mind Express, Communicator, Symwriter, etc.), or are intending to purchase such software, you may be able to use this to develop and print charts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes you can access chart making software through your local Speech and Language Therapy service or through a child’s educational environment. There are also a few counties that offer access to such software through their library service. You could contact your local library service to find out if this is available in your area. Some charities / nonprofit organisations also offer access to software.</p>

<p><a id="PODD"></a><strong>PODD</strong> (Pragmatic Organisation Dynamic Display)* is a complete communication system that was developed by Australian Speech Pathologist, Gayle Porter. The software needed to print out the various levels of Direct Access PODD books is available to purchase in the UK from http:// inclusive.co.uk. Templates range from books with 9 cells per page up to those with 90 cells per page, with many options in between.</p>

<p>While there is always a need to personalise a communication book, a PODD book aims to provide the vast majority of the vocabulary you could need in a carefully structured format to encourage rich communication. The PODD resource comes with a detailed book that is full of ideas and information about supporting both PODD books and low tech communication more generally. You can find some great videos of PODD in action on YouTube!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Direct Access PODD templates are designed for direct pointing with a whole hand, finger or tool. Some of the templates can be modified to accommodate pick up and show or listener mediated scanning access methods (using columnrow scanning).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There has been talk for some time of the impending release of Alternative Access PODD with templates for eye pointing, listener mediated scanning, coded access and combination access. However, at the time of writing these are not commercially available. This means that you would need to undertake the adaptation yourself, although there is guidance on how to go about modifying pages within the main PODD manual. There is also a lot of information about using, adapting and supporting PODD within the handouts section of Linda Burkhart’s website - <a href="http://lburkhart.com" class="bare">lburkhart.com</a>. For those who are already familiar with PODD, this handout from Spectronics may be of interest <a href="http://acecent.re/1JPxaYI" class="bare">acecent.re/1JPxaYI</a> as it talks about adaptations to PODD.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Courses on PODD are available in the UK, and are a great way of learning more about this way of communicating. Contact Rosemary Clark for more information - <a href="mailto:podd@woodlands.surrey.sch.uk">podd@woodlands.surrey.sch.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication passports are a way of drawing together and sharing information about how a person communicates. A communication passport can give information about both a person’s understanding and how they express themselves. They are a really helpful tool to have alongside any form of AAC, but are particularly important where people are using alternative access methods such as eye pointing, encoding, listener mediated scanning, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A communication passport is often a printed document. However, some people also find it helpful to have a video passport alongside the printed version as it can sometimes be much easier to show someone’s ‘yes’ and ‘no’ response, and how it might vary with fatigue, for example, rather than attempt to describe it in words. You may also find communication passports made as a powerpoint presentation. If someone uses a high tech communication aid, it may be worth keeping a copy of the communication passport on the device itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When developing a communication passport, it’s essential to involve the person in its development as much as possible. The individual needs to have ownership of their communication passport, particularly if it is written in ‘their’ voice. Person-centred planning approaches have a useful role to play here.</p>
