<p>The aim of this resource is help you design and use alphabet charts with people who can’t rely on speech, enabling them to communicate to the best of their ability.  Through communication we can express ourselves, learn, have fun, and be active members of society</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please note that this resource is not suggesting that low tech is ‘best’, or that low tech is a prerequisite to a more high tech communication aid.  It is simply about valuing the role of paper based communication systems, and sharing lots of ideas and strategies to help develop and support them.  You may well find that many of the ideas and strategies are useful when it comes to other forms of communication too.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alphabet charts can be a powerful way to support face-to-face communication for individuals who are unable to rely upon speech to communicate in all situations, all of the time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alphabet charts are one form of <a href="#aac">Augmentative and Alternative Communication (or AAC)</a>. Specifically, they are a type of <a href="#low-tech-communication">low tech</a> AAC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term <em>Augmentative and Alternative Communication</em> includes both strategies and equipment that supports or replaces speech.  It might involve using your body, e.g. <a href="#signing">signing</a>, facial expression, gesture, or using equipment, e.g. an <a href="#alphabet-chart">alphabet chart</a>, a <a href="#symbol-chart">symbol chart</a>, a simple <a href="#talking-button">talking button</a>, a more complex <a href="#voice-output-communication-aid">voice output communication aid</a>, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason it is <em>Augmentative and Alternative Communication</em> rather than just Alternative Communication (two ‘A’s’ instead of 1) is to emphasise that AAC is not just for people who cannot speak at all, and need an alternative. AAC is also for people who have speech but whose speech is not sufficient or clear enough for everyone to understand them all of the time. In other words, AAC can augment or support someone’s speech as well as provide an alternative to speech where there is none.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AAC is often subdivided into low tech and <a href="#high-tech-communication">high tech</a> sub-categories. High tech AAC is AAC that involves equipment that has a battery or a screen.  Low tech AAC is essentially everything else!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This resource is all about using <a href="#text-based-low-tech-aac">text based low tech AAC</a>, or alphabet charts.  It takes a close look at how to get started, and how to support those who are unable to spell what they want to say. To find out more about low tech AAC that is designed around pictures and symbols, see <em>Getting Started with AAC: Using low tech symbol based systems with children.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While some people choose to rely predominantly upon an alphabet chart to support their face-to-face communication, typically someone will use an alphabet chart alongside a host of other communication strategies, including gesture, signing, vocalisation and sometimes high tech AAC. We all communicate in different ways with different people and in different situations.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using an alphabet chart is complementary to other forms of AAC.  It is in no sense a ‘prerequisite’ to using a voice output communication aid.  However, if someone does have a very sophisticated communication aid that they rely on most of the time, it is still important to maintain other ways of communicating, and an alphabet chart can be an essential back up.  Sophisticated communication aids are much more prone to running out of battery and going wrong occasionally than paper-based tools.  There are also situations where they can be impractical, for example, in the middle of the night, or whilst bathing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While alphabet charts are an obvious tool for those who are literate, they are also highly recommended to be used alongside a symbol based communication book for those at the very earliest stages of literacy.  Alphabet charts can be a great way to support early exploration of speech sounds and spelling, particularly for those who find holding a pencil more difficult.  If you are interested in finding out more about this, Karen Erickson and David Koppenhaver at the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies in North Carolina have done a lot of work in this area - see <a href="http://med.unc.edu/ahs/clds" class="bare">med.unc.edu/ahs/clds</a>.</p>

<p>Anjali is sixteen years old.  She has cerebral palsy, autism and epilepsy.  She is able to verbalise a range of sounds, but cannot speak any recognisable words.  The fact that speech is difficult, however, doesn’t mean that her literacy skills aren’t good.  Indeed, Anjali can read and spell well, and she uses an alphabetically organised alphabet chart to support her communication.</p>

<p>Anjali chats to Suzanne with the help of her alphabet</p>

<p>Anjali uses her chart with everyone!!! She is very proficient at pointing to letters and loves to ask questions such, “which supermarket do you shop at?” Anjali is also exploring whether a voice output communication aid might be useful to her, alongside this chart.</p>

<h5 id="_tiago"><a class="anchor" href="#_tiago"></a><a class="link" href="#_tiago">Tiago</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tiago is eight years old. He has cerebral palsy and finds it difficult to use his hands. He can communicate using speech with people who know him very well, but even then things sometimes go a bit wrong. He uses an alphabet chart that has been specially adapted for use with eye movements. Copies are all round his house so that one can be reached quickly in the event of a problem. There are copies tucked down the side of the sofa, in the bathroom, in the kitchen, in his bedroom - all over the place! There’s also a copy of the alphabet chart
permanently attached to his wheelchair.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tiago uses his eye movements to select letters from the special alphabet chart. The chart is an <a href="#_encoded_layout">Encoded Layout</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tiago also has a sophisticated computer to support his communication that he controls using eye movements. He is a great reader and speller, and can use an onscreen keyboard to spell out and then speak what he wants to say. However,
there are times when computers just aren’t up to the job. Recently he was travelling in the back of the car with his step-sister, and she just couldn’t work out what he was saying. Frustration all round! The computer was in the boot, but couldn’t be used in the back seat of the car anyway. Luckily,
Mum was in the front seat and had an alphabet chart to hand - she passed it back to them, and the problem was easily resolved.</p>

<p>The term <a href="#direct-touch">direct touch</a> or <a href="#direct-selection">direct selection</a> describes the way someone points to letters or words on a chart using a bit of their body. People most often point using a finger, but sometimes use a fist, elbow, toe, or whatever works best for them. They may also use a <a href="#pointing-tool">pointing tool</a> to facilitate direct touch. You can never generalise when it comes to AAC(!), but typically, if someone can access a chart directly, this tends to be the preferred way of selecting letters (the <a href="#selection-method">selection method</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When pointing is difficult, there are different options that can be considered. One option is to consider ways to support direct access. Another option is to look at alternative access methods, including <a href="#eye-pointing">eye pointing</a> to letters, <a href="#listener-mediated-scanning">listener mediated scanning</a> (sometimes called <a href="#partner-assisted-scanning">partner assisted scanning</a>), and <a href="#combination-access">combination access</a>.</p>

<p>Conventional alphabet charts are designed to be accessed using an index finger. The letters are neatly laid out in alphabetical or qwerty order, and the individual points to letters to spell out words and phrases.</p>

<p>Where possible, a one-finger point is beneficial, as it helps the <a href="#communication-partner">communication partner</a> to follow what is being spelled out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes an individual may need help to learn that one particular finger is in charge of ‘pointing’. As a temporary teaching tool, a sticker or some nail varnish on the fingernail of the pointing finger can help to signal to the individual (and communication partner) what to pay attention to. Alternatively, for people who are happy to wear a glove, you could try cutting off the end of the glove’s pointing finger.</p>

<p>When learning new skills, it can be good to try to avoid the pressure of attempting to communicate something really important. Instead, you could practise pointing to letters within a game such as I spy or something similar. Try to feedback to the person about where you think they are pointing to, to further reinforce their learning.</p>

<h5 id="_placement"><a class="anchor" href="#_placement"></a><a class="link" href="#_placement">Placement</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A person’s visual and physical skills should influence where the chart itself is placed in relation to that individual. Simply placing the alphabet chart in an area that is easier to reach can make a difference. For example, if someone uses only their right hand to access a chart, it may be helpful to place the chart slightly to their right. Small changes can sometimes make a big difference.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, you may want to design your own layout based around the individual’s skills. For example, if they find it much easier to point to the right hand side of the page, then you might want to put letters that are used more frequently to the right, and letters like ‘z’ and ‘qu’ to the left. <a href="#_chapter_4_chart_design">Chapter 4: Chart design</a>  discusses key issues to consider when planning a keyboard layout.</p>

<p>Charts are often presented flat on a table or on a wheelchair tray.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way of ‘pointing’ to a chart is to use a <a href="#laser-pointer">laser pointer</a>. These tend to be designed to help presenters indicate key points on their PowerPoint presentations. However, some people choose to use them to point to letters on an alphabet chart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The easiest way to do this is to attach a small laser pointer to a pair of glasses. The person gently moves their head to direct the laser beam onto letters or words on a chart. However, they could be handheld, or attached to the body in another way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To avoid damage to eyes, make sure you choose an ‘eye-safe’ laser. You can view a video of someone using a laser pointer to access an alphabet chart with whole words here <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=AooDQOzdOyE" class="bare">youtube.com/watch?v=AooDQOzdOyE</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_eye_pointing"><a class="anchor" href="#_eye_pointing"></a><a class="link" href="#_eye_pointing">Eye-pointing</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When pointing directly to letters is difficult, another option is to point to letters with your eyes. Although people can feel a bit worried about it, and feel scared that they won’t be able to ‘read’ someone’s eye movements, it’s often easier than you think. It can also be surprisingly quick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eye pointing to letters is probably most often done using an E-tran frame with <a href="#encoding">encoding</a> as it minimises the number of different eye movements that the communication partner has to interpret. There are different ways of encoding, and you can read more about these here <a href="#_encoded_layout">Encoded Layout</a>. The examples in this section make use of colour encoding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, there is another way of eye pointing to letters that is perhaps less well known and used, but can be highly successful for some. This is a strategy where you eye point directly to letters arranged on a transparent sheet known as an <a href="#eyelink">Eyelink</a> communication chart.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EyeLink chart is designed to be held between two people. Because the chart is transparent, the communication partner can see which letter the individual is eye pointing to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An EyeLink communication chart can be made by placing individually cut up letters into a glossy laminate pocket and running it through a laminator. Alternatively, the alphabet could be printed onto an acetate sheet. For a more robust chart, you could have the letters printed onto transparent plastic, or even attach letters onto a Perspex® board.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use the chart, the communication partner holds it between themselves and the individual. Typically, the ‘correct’ layout of letters faces the communicator, and the communication partner sees the mirror image. This does not have to be the case, however. In the video of Lisa using her own EyeLink style chart below, we see that she does things the other way round. Here it is Lisa who uses the mirror image while her PA sees the ‘correct’ (alphabetically arranged) layout. This may help unfamiliar communication partners use this method of communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use an EyeLink chart, the individual looks at the letter they wish to select. The communication partner moves the chart in response to where the individual is looking, until they end up both looking at the same letter. The communication partner speaks aloud the letter and the individual can indicate if a mistake has been made. You can view an instructional video of this access method at <a href="https://vimeo.com/53036535" class="bare">vimeo.com/53036535</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this video of Lisa and her PA, she explains how she uses the EyeLink chart. Lisa’s PA is able to predict many of the words she is saying after the first letter or two. If she makes a mistake, Lisa simply shakes her head and carries on spelling the word.</p>

<p>In order to help make eye pointing easier to read, an <a href="#e-tran-frame">E-tran frame</a> (or <a href="#eye-transfer-frame">eye transfer frame</a>) can be used.  An E-tran frame is a perspex rectangle with a central window removed.  The idea is that the communication partner holds the frame between themselves and the communicator, making eye contact through the central window.  The central window can make it easier for the communication partner to read the communicator’s eye movements.  A mirror image of what is shown on the E-tran frame tends to be placed on the communication partner’s side to make it easier for them to follow what is being communicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Frenchay E-tran frame is a well known commercially available E-tran frame.  It is available from a number of suppliers e.g. <a href="http://www.liberator.co.uk" class="bare">www.liberator.co.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could purchase a blank E-tran frame (e.g. from <a href="http://www.liberator.co.uk" class="bare">www.liberator.co.uk</a>) and attach your own letters.  Alternatively you could approach a glass supplier and see if they would cut some Perspex to size for you (don’t forget to ask them to round the corners!).  Some online companies also offer a cut-to-size option for perspex or acrylic sheets.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’ve got access to a laminator, a cheap way of producing an E-tran frame is to make use of a piece of gloss laminate. It’s not as robust as a Perspex® frame, but it can work well. Simply pop the letters (ideally with the mirror image on the back) into the laminate pouch and run it through the laminator. Although we often recommend matt laminate, for this purpose, gloss laminate works a bit better as it is more transparent. Gloss laminate is what <a href="#_tiago">Tiago</a> chooses to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, you could create something that looks a little more like an E-tran frame using a combination of paper and laminate. In this case, matt laminate works best.</p>

<p>The Speakbook is a freely available communication book that offers access to whole words and useful phrases alongside an encoded alphabet chart. It is designed to be held like an Etran frame. You can read more about it at <a href="http://speakbook.org" class="bare">speakbook.org</a>.</p>

<p>Another way of presenting an alphabet chart for eye pointing is to display it in an easel file / binder. Although it can be harder to read, some people manage eye pointing to paper that is held upright by the file very successfully. Easel files are available from some of the large office stationery suppliers (e.g. Viking Direct, Staples, etc.) Alternatively, alongside their Look2Talk Guide, Ace Centre produces a more robust easel file that can be purchased as a standalone item – see <a href="http://acecentre.org.uk" class="bare">acecentre.org.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the assumption is often that ‘bigger is better’, some people prefer to use a chart that is more discrete. Some of <a href="#_tiago">Tiago</a>'s charts, for example, are A5 size - and charts can be made smaller still.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below is an example of a very small encoded chart. The arrows show the eye movements involved in communicating the letters to be selected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is probably fair to say that if the chart is very small, the person using their eyes is going to have to work extra hard to ensure their eye pointing is clear, and may need to exaggerate their eye movements when communicating with people who are less familiar with communicating with them.</p>

<p>The examples above have tended to show six blocks of letters arranged in a landscape layout. However, some people find it easier to eye point to different layouts. Letters could be arranged in the shape of a cross for example, so that the communicator uses up / down and left / right eye movements (this is how the second selection is made with Vocal Eyes described below in <a href="#_encoding_using_position">Encoding (using position)</a>, or they could be placed in more of a ‘zig zag’ configuration. It’s all about working together to find out what is easiest for the individual you are communicating with.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the challenges of using eye pointing with an E-tran frame or similar is differentiating between a ‘searching’ look and a ‘choosing’ look. In other words, how does the communication partner know whether the communicator is still searching for the right letter, or actually looking at the letter they want?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One strategy that can work is the, ‘Look back at me’ strategy. Here, the communication partner encourages the communicator to look through the various letters, then look purposefully at the desired letter when they find it (briefly holding their gaze on it), and finally looking back at the communication partner to confirm that a choice has been made.</p>

<h5 id="_tips_for_communication_partners"><a class="anchor" href="#_tips_for_communication_partners"></a><a class="link" href="#_tips_for_communication_partners">Tips for Communication Partners</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the early stages, a communication partner may need to double check whether they have correctly ‘read’ the eye pointing. Beware of falling into the trap of asking someone to indicate ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to every letter they have selected all of the time, however, as it is really frustrating to be asked to ‘repeat’ yourself, and can slow communication down. Often it is quicker to rely upon the communicator to let you know when you’ve got it wrong - for example by pulling a face, or looking away completely. Rather than asking questions, try making statements. For example, instead of asking, “Are you looking at ‘e’?”, try stating, “You are looking at ‘e’.” The individual can still respond to the statement and make it clear that you are wrong, but the statement form stops the communicator from feeling that you are ‘double checking’ or questioning their every utterance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A pen and paper can be an incredibly useful piece of equipment for a struggling communication partner! If you are engaged in a long conversation using an eye pointing alphabet chart, it is easy to lose your way, or forget where you have got to within a word. If you write down the letters as they are spelled out, this can really help you keep track of things.</p>
</div>

<h5 id="_learning_eye_pointing"><a class="anchor" href="#_learning_eye_pointing"></a><a class="link" href="#_learning_eye_pointing">Learning Eye Pointing</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learning to make a selection using eye pointing involves lots of different skills, and is not necessarily something that everyone will be able to do immediately. You can still get started with eye pointing by using it within fun games or play activities, particularly with a child, and responding to where you think the person is looking. This can provide an opportunity within which to ‘teach’ eye pointing skills in a fun and motivating way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If using eye-pointing to purposefully communicate messages is proving too difficult for an individual for whatever reason, it may be worth thinking about another access method, such as <a href="#_listener_mediated_scanning">Listener Mediated Scanning</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_listener_mediated_scanning"><a class="anchor" href="#_listener_mediated_scanning"></a><a class="link" href="#_listener_mediated_scanning">Listener Mediated Scanning</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Listener mediated scanning is the term used to describe the access method whereby a communication partner delivers the options that are available. They might do this by pointing to letters (<a href="#visual-scanning">visual scanning</a>), speaking aloud the letters (<a href="#auditory-scanning">auditory scanning</a>), or both (<a href="#visual-and-auditory-scanning">visual and auditory scanning</a>). The individual indicates ‘yes’ when the communication partner has reached the desired option. Listener mediated scanning is also known as partner assisted scanning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Listener mediated scanning may be someone’s primary access method to an alphabet chart. Alternatively it may be used by someone who uses direct access some of the time, and listener mediated scanning when they are fatigued / ill.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_how_it_works"><a class="anchor" href="#_how_it_works"></a><a class="link" href="#_how_it_works">How it Works</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simplest way of scanning through the alphabet is to offer each letter in turn. However, this can be time consuming. For example, to get to the letter ‘t’, you have to first speak aloud and / or point to, nineteen other letters. To speed up the process of communication, you may want to divide the alphabet into groups in some way. Grouping really does increase the speed at which letters can be accessed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This ABC keyboard has been organised so that the vowels appear at the beginning of each row of letters. This can be a very neat way of dividing up the alphabet.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="Media/images/0EWaRXs.png"><img src="Media/images/0EWaRXs-thumb.png" alt="ABC Keyboard" width="300"></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, the communication partner would read aloud and / or point to each vowel in turn. This makes it much quicker than working through the whole alphabet letter-by-letter. If the individual wanted the letter ‘G’, they would indicate “yes” once they heard and / or saw the letter ‘E’. The communication partner would then say / point to the letters in that row until the individual indicated “yes” i.e. ‘E’, ‘F’, ‘G’ – “yes”.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The chart is offered row-by-row, then once a row has been selected, letter-by-letter within the chosen row.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Others choose to divide up the alphabet differently. For example, some people divide the alphabet in half, offering ‘A’ or ‘N’ as a start. In this example, if someone wanted to say the letter ‘R’, they would indicate “yes” once they heard the letter ‘N’ offered. The communication partner would then say / point to the letters from ‘N’. Once they got to the letter ‘R’, the individual would indicate “yes” i.e. ‘N’, ‘O’, ‘P’, ‘Q’, ‘R’ – “yes”.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The alphabet is divided in half to speed access to the letters. The communication partner first offers ‘A’ or ‘N’, then the letters following either ‘A’ or ‘N’, depending upon the choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#frequency-alphabet-charts">Frequency alphabet charts</a> can also be a valuable tool to support listener mediated scanning. Indeed, Jean-Dominique Bauby ‘dictated’ his famous memoir, <em>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</em>, using listener mediated scanning with an alphabet chart that was organised according to the frequency of use of letters in the French alphabet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This English frequency alphabet chart has been designed to be used with listener mediated scanning. The communication partner first establishes the row and then the individual letter or number that is desired. The most frequently used letters are close to the top left hand corner so that they can be selected the most quickly using this method.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If someone wanted to communicate the letter ‘S’, for example, the communication partner would offer ‘space’, ‘e’, ‘a’ – “yes”. The communication partner would then offer the letters within the chosen row ‘a’, ‘s’ – “yes”. Alternatively, they could simply offer the chart row by row, and then speak aloud the letters within the chosen row. The video should make this a little clearer!</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, the communication partner is offering each row in turn without speaking aloud the first letter. This is down to personal choice. The main thing is to ensure that, once a strategy has been agreed, this information is shared so that everyone does the same thing!</p>

<h5 id="_making_a_selection"><a class="anchor" href="#_making_a_selection"></a><a class="link" href="#_making_a_selection">Making a Selection</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Listener mediated scanning is easiest to use when an individual is able to communicate both ‘yes’ and ‘no’. However, so long as the individual has a way of communicating ‘yes’, then listener mediated scanning is viable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two ways of making selections:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The individual waits until they see and / or hear the desired option and then indicates ‘yes that’s the one I want’ by an agreed movement or vocalisation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>or</em></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The individual communicates ‘no’ after each option offered (by an agreed movement or vocalisation) until they see and / or hear the desired option and then indicates ‘yes that’s the one I want’ by an agreed movement or vocalisation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantage of the first method is that it is quicker and less effortful for the individual using the system to communicate. Effectively they can sit back and relax until the desired option is seen and / or heard. However, it can mean that a desired option is missed, particularly by a listener / communication partner who is not experienced and rushes through the options or misses the agreed affirmative signal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantage of the second method is that it can be more reliable as the communication partner / listener does not move onto the next option until they have established that the individual does not want the option offered. The disadvantage is that this can make the whole process much slower and more effortful for the individual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In practise, where an individual does have a reliable way of indicating ‘yes’ and ‘no’, people often choose to get started using the second method, moving to the first method as both the individual and the communication partner gain confidence in this access method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The method by which an individual indicates acceptance of an option should be clearly documented on the alphabet chart and in the <a href="#_chapter_6_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together">communication passport</a> if present.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_delivering_the_list"><a class="anchor" href="#_delivering_the_list"></a><a class="link" href="#_delivering_the_list">Delivering the List</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using auditory scanning or combined auditory and visual scanning, try to read through the options using a neutral voice. Keep expression to a minimum, and use as low a volume as is appropriate to the individual and setting. When the individual has spelled out a word, you can then say that aloud in a more natural / social voice. If you listen again to the three videos in this section, you should hear the difference in tone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When speaking aloud the letters, remember to pause long enough between each letter to give the individual time to respond. It can be helpful to document how long to leave between each letter to ensure that the chart is delivered in a consistent way by all communication partners.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_smart_partner"><a class="anchor" href="#_smart_partner"></a><a class="link" href="#_smart_partner">Smart Partner</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The joy of a low tech scanning system (i.e. one that is operated by a person rather than a computer) is that you are so much cleverer than a computer! If you are reading through letters and there is a sudden noisy distraction, you know to pause and allow time for that to pass. If the individual is tired that day, you know to read through the options more slowly. You may also be able to spot a ‘yes’ response that is being initiated, even if it is not quite on target due to fatigue or illness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But sometimes partners aren’t so smart! With scanning systems it is incredibly important to ensure that individual partners understand how to use the system and use it consistently. It is also important to ensure that all communication partners use the system in the same way. Written instructions are essential. Given the complexities, a short video may also be useful for new communication partners. A  <a href="#_chapter_6_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together"><em>communication passport</em></a> can be very helpful too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also important to establish whether the individual is happy for you to guess what they are spelling out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>Combination access means using more than one access method within a system.</p>

<p>In this example, the individual eye points to one of the four blocks. The communication partner then uses listener mediated scanning to offer the letters within that block.</p>

</div>

<p>Some people use a combination of different access methods depending upon mood / energy levels / well-being. For example, someone might point directly to an alphabet chart during the day, but move to listener mediated scanning in the evening when they are fatigued.</p>

With assistance, the communicator points to symbols such as letters, pictures and/or objects.”  American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA).

<p>Because of the physical input of another person into the construction of the message, there have been anxieties around the integrity of this access method.  ISAAC (The International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication) released a position statement in July 2014 that states that they do not support FC as a valid form of AAC or a valid access method. This position statement was produced after a committee of researchers carried out a literature review of research that examined authorship and the discussions of the committee were confined to this aspect of FC/FCT.</p>

<p>CandLE is a national AAC organisation that has a lot of expertise in this area.  CandLE has developed an alternative approach called Motor Planning Training (MPT).

<p>Alphabet charts can be laid out in different ways. There are advantages and disadvantages to each method, and some suit different access methods better than others. At the end of the day, the choice will come down to personal preference and what seems to work best for an individual and their communication partner(s). You may also want to think about how an individual uses the alphabet when writing and accessing a computer. Sometimes there are good reasons for having different layouts across different tools, but it’s often a good idea to be as consistent as possible.</p>

<h4 id="_qwerty_layout"><a class="anchor" href="#_qwerty_layout"></a><a class="link" href="#_qwerty_layout">QWERTY layout￼</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many people are now familiar with a QWERTY keyboard, as this is the arrangement of letters that you find on computers and typewriters. For those who know the layout well, or who will be using a standard computer keyboard regularly, this may be the best option to go for as they may already know the location of the letters and consequently won’t have to ‘hunt around’ for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an example of an alphabet chart made using a QWERTY layout. It has been designed to be accessed directly.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>QWERTY layouts can work well for people accessing charts by direct touch but for those using alternative access methods such as eye pointing and listener mediated scanning, it may be worth thinking about a different layout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, even for those accessing by direct touch, it may be worth thinking carefully about why a QWERTY layout is being used. The QWERTY keyboard layout was devised in the late 1800s for use on a manual typewriter to reduce the jams that could occur when typing neighbouring letters consecutively. In other words, it is not a layout that was designed to speed up letter selection. Also, it is worth noting that the QWERTY layout was designed to be used with ten fingers. For someone using one finger or some sort of <em>pointing tool</em>, the QWERTY layout will necessitate a lot of movement around the keyboard, and if movement is difficult or fatiguing, this may not be ideal. For someone who is not familiar with the QWERTY layout, or who finds the process of selecting letters slow or laborious, it may be worth considering an alternative layout.</p>

<p><strong>Why consider QWERTY?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>QWERTY is a keyboard layout that is familiar for people who have used computer keyboards, or may become familiar to a child who is going to be using a computer keyboard</p>

<p><strong>What are the disadvantages?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For someone who is not familiar with a computer keyboard, it may take extra time to learn where to find the letters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The QWERTY layout was not designed to meet the needs of someone who is pointing with one finger / body part, or who is using an alternative access method.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_abc_alphabetical_layout"><a class="anchor" href="#_abc_alphabetical_layout"></a><a class="link" href="#_abc_alphabetical_layout">ABC / Alphabetical Layout</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most people learn letters in alphabetical order, so providing an ABC keyboard arrangement should tap into that familiarity. However, for someone used to using a QWERTY keyboard, it can be difficult to make the transition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an example of a simple ABC layout alphabet chart:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<a class="image" href="Media/images/n0PCUcO.jpg"><img src="Media/images/n0PCUcO-thumb.jpg" alt="alphabetical layout" width="300"></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>￼Arranging letters in alphabetical order has the advantage of minimising the time needed to learn where the letters are, as the layout should feel familiar. As with the QWERTY layout, however, a potential disadvantage is the ABC layout has not been designed to meet the needs of someone spelling using one finger / body part. This means that someone may be making more movements around the chart than if they were using a <a href="#frequency-alphabet-charts">frequency layout</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to people’s familiarity with alphabetical order, an ABC keyboard can work particularly well for someone using <a href="#_listener_mediated_scanning">Listener Mediated Scanning</a> as the individual doesn’t have to watch or listen quite so intently.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Why consider ABC?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ABC is a keyboard layout that should feel familiar to everyone as it taps into our knowledge of the alphabet. This can help both the person using the chart and the communication partner.</p>

<p><strong>What are the disadvantages?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ABC layout can be confusing for someone who is highly familiar with a QWERTY keyboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like the QWERTY layout, the ABC layout has not been optimised to meet the needs of someone who is pointing with one finger / body part, or who is using an alternative access method.</p>

<h4 id="frequency-alphabet-charts"><a class="anchor" href="#frequency-alphabet-charts"></a><a class="link" href="#frequency-alphabet-charts">Frequency Layout</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frequency layout describes an approach where letters are arranged so that the most frequently used letters in a word (e.g. ‘e’ and ‘t’) can be accessed more quickly or easily than letters that are used infrequently (such as ‘q’ and ‘z’). Unlike QWERTY and ABC, there is no, one ‘standard’ frequency layout. Instead, there are a variety of frequency layouts that have been designed and suggested.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The design of a frequency layout will be affected by the access method being used. A frequency layout for someone using direct touch will look very different from a frequency layout for someone using listener mediated scanning. If letters are being read aloud to an individual, a frequency layout would ensure that the most frequently used letters were at the beginning of the list. However, if the letters are being selected by an individual directly using a single finger or a pointing tool, it may be better to place the most frequently used letters in the centre of the page to minimise movement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If someone is using an onscreen keyboard arranged according to frequency of use to write on a computer, you may want to copy this layout for their communication chart. Otherwise, it could be confusing to learn and use two similar but subtly different keyboard layouts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The FITALY keyboard is one example of a frequency layout designed for one finger direct selection. See <a href="http://fitaly.com/fitaly/ofkey.htm" class="bare">fitaly.com/fitaly/ofkey.htm</a> for more information. This layout has been designed to minimise the amount of movement required when spelling words using a single finger. The most frequently used letters are towards the centre of the chart, whilst less frequently used letters are around the edges. Although invented and patented by Jean Ichbiah for use with a computer or handheld device, the keyboard layout could also work well as a <em>low tech</em> <em>alphabet chart</em>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The chart below is an example of a frequency layout that has been optimised for use with listener mediated scanning. The communication partner first establishes the row and then the individual letter or number that is desired. The most frequently used letters are close to the top left hand corner so that they can be selected the most quickly using this method.</p>

<p>As described in Chapter 2, if someone wanted to communicate the letter ‘s’, for example, the communication partner would offer ‘space’, ‘e’, ‘a’ – “yes”. The communication partner would then offer ‘a’, ‘s’ – “yes”. This can be seen in action <a href="#e-tran-frames">here</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Encoding is a way of helping someone to use direct access where they aren’t able to point to the 26 individual letters of the alphabet on an alphabet chart. Encoding groups letters together, reducing the number of target areas on a page. This means that someone who is pointing using a fist for example, simply needs to indicate a group of letters, rather than trying to isolate an individual letter. They then clarify which letter they wish to communicate using a second movement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an example of an alphabet chart that has been encoded using colour for an individual using direct touch e.g. pointing with their fist.</p>

<p>To select the letter ‘b’, you would first select the block containing the characters ‘a’,‘b’, ‘c’, ‘1’, ‘2’ and ‘3’. Then, to clarify that it was the letter ‘b’ you were targeting (rather than a, c, 1, 2 or 3), you would then select the gold dot because ‘b’ is coloured gold in this example. Similarly, to select the number ‘8’, you would first select the block containing the characters ‘g’, ‘h’, ‘i’, ‘7’, ‘8’ and ‘9’. Then, to clarify that it was the number ‘8’ you wanted, you would then select the black dot because ‘8’ is coloured black in this example. With just six movements, you are able to select from thirty-six different characters.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coded layouts effectively make use of a grid reference system. Letters and words / phrases are given a grid reference that the individual communicates. It requires two separate charts to communicate. One chart contains your letters (and words / phrases), the other allows you to communicate the location of the letter / word / phrase you wish to communicate. It’s a bit like using a map – you look up the location of a road in your street atlas and it tells you the grid reference on the page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coded access is not straightforward, and it is essential that the system is well documented, perhaps in a <a href="#_chapter_6_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together">communication passport</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, the first chart shows the letters on offer. The second smaller chart is accessed by the individual to indicate the code, thus identifying the target letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To communicate the letter ‘P’, the individual would first select the number 3, as ‘P’ is in the third row. They would then select the colour blue as ‘P’ is in the blue column. This example set up might be used by someone who is able to indicate small targets accurately, but would find the range of movement required to access a full alphabet chart too difficult.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This video demonstrates how the two example charts can be used to communicate a message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coded access tends to be used when direct access is difficult. Someone might find it easier to point to a small set of codes rather than a full <em>alphabet chart</em>, either because they find it hard to refine a point sufficiently to point to 26 separate letters plus additional words / phrases, or because they are unable to move their hand around a full chart and need a smaller set of options. The codes can also be presented on an E-tran frame and accessed using eye pointing, or presented using listener mediated scanning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coded access charts tend to be highly customised to the needs of a particular individual, and they can be very complex. The downside of such charts is that often the individual themselves can use it extremely well, but unfamiliar <em>communication partners</em> can feel lost or scared by it. Someone who is confident with a complex coded chart may also require a more straightforward communication chart to deal with such situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although coded access tends to involve the use of two charts (one containing the target letters, the other containing the codes), this example shows how it is possible to combine them all onto one chart. This chart was developed by a Speech and Language Therapist called Susan Stayte for a young man with excellent eye pointing skills who wanted to be able to communicate a lot of things very quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The chart is shown here to raise awareness of the possibilities of chart design for people who are literate and want fast access to complex language. The alphabet is accessed using standard <a href="#_encoded_layout">Encoded Layout</a>. The individual first looks at the group of six letters, then clarifies their choice by looking to the corresponding coloured border. However, the key words are accessed using a code. The individual first looks at the block containing their target word, and then communicates the numerical code associated with that word.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When designing and using a communication chart, you will need to take someone’s physical and visual skills into account, both in terms of design and placement of the chart. There are a number of things you may want to bear in mind:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_upper_or_lower_case"><a class="anchor" href="#_upper_or_lower_case"></a><a class="link" href="#_upper_or_lower_case">Upper or Lower Case</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may want to give someone the choice of what case (upper or lower) they would prefer to have their alphabet chart produced in. Note that younger children in the UK are often more familiar with lower case letters, and may find a chart made using lower case letters more accessible. Having said that, exposure to both cases is an important part of literacy development.</p>

<h5 id="_size_colour_and_font"><a class="anchor" href="#_size_colour_and_font"></a><a class="link" href="#_size_colour_and_font">Size, Colour and Font</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When making an alphabet chart, you will need to consider how big to make it, and what size and style of font to use. This decision will be affected by someone’s visual skills. They need to be able to see what is written clearly and easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The decision about size may also be affected by someone’s physical skills, particularly if they are accessing the chart by direct touch. For someone with a limited range of movement, a little chart may be easier. For someone with less refined movements, a larger chart may be easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the overall size of the chart, you may want to think about how much space to leave between letters and individual words. The amount of space between items can affect how well someone can see what is written, and also the accuracy with which they can point to items.</p>

<p>It is worth checking whether any vision assessments have been carried out as the information within such a report can be very helpful when personalising a chart. A child in school may have support from an advisory teacher for vision impairment (e.g. QTVI, Qualified Teacher of learners with Visual Impairment) – ask their advice on how best to present information. If someone wears glasses but doesn’t always remember, or choose, to wear them, you may want to consider designing the chart so that the font is easily visible to them, even when without their glasses. In practice, chart design for someone with a visual difficulty is likely to involve a bit of trial and error along the way!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes a chart can be made easier to see by experimenting with the use of colour. Visual accessibility can be increased by using a high level of contrast between the background and foreground colours. Commonly used high contrast combinations include yellow and black, and yellow and blue. Think about contrast, but also glare. For example, a large expanse of bright yellow background might generate a lot of glare that could make it difficult for an individual to use the chart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the example below, the black page background may help the yellow cells containing the yellow letters to stand out.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is often advisable to avoid gloss laminate, which can reflect overhead lighting and cause distortion and glare - and rely instead on matt laminate. Alternatively you could print the chart on so-called ‘indestructible’, tear-proof or waterproof printer paper.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the person’s own visual skills, you may also want to consider the visual skills of any key communication partners, as they need to be able to see and easily read what is spelled out.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h5 id="_placement_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_placement_2"></a><a class="link" href="#_placement_2">Placement</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Visual and physical skills can also affect both where letters are placed on a chart, and where the chart itself is placed in relation to the individual. For example, if someone finds it easier to reach or see letters in one area than another, you may want to put high frequency or commonly used letters in the easier to reach area, and lower frequency letters like ‘q’ and ‘z’ in the harder to reach area. For another example, if someone is just using their right hand to access a chart, it may be helpful to place the chart slightly to the right.</p>

It is accessed by <a href="#_listener_mediated_scanning">Listener Mediated Scanning</a>. The letters of the alphabet are presented in horizontal rows, one row at a time.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For people who have a significant visual impairment, but are able to point directly to letters, alphabet charts can also be constructed using either alphabet based tactile codes like Moon or Braille.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Braille is a tactile alphabet system that is made up of raised dots. You can find out more on the RNIB website – <a href="http://rnib.org.uk" class="bare">rnib.org.uk</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moon is a system of raised curves and lines, with one shape corresponding to each letter. More than half of the shapes resemble the print equivalent of the letter. Moon is much less widely known and supported. You can find out more at <a href="http://moonliteracy.org.uk" class="bare">moonliteracy.org.uk</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When constructing a tactile alphabet chart, it is important to show the corresponding print letter alongside the raised letter to assist the communication partner in interpreting the message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alphabet chart could be constructed using braille keyboard stickers. These stickers are available from www.a2i.co.uk (<a href="http://acecent.re/1EURCGg" class="bare">acecent.re/1EURCGg</a>). Alternatively, you could produce braille letters using the 6dot™ Braille Label Maker™ which is available from Logan Technologies <a href="http://logantechnologies.co.uk/braille-label-maker" class="bare">logantechnologies.co.uk/braille-label-maker</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to letters on an alphabet chart, you may want to consider providing easy access to commonly spoken words and phrases. This may be to support someone who is able to read well, but finds spelling what they want to say more tricky. Young children may be developing their reading skills nicely, and find that they need the support of whole words and phrases, or even symbols, alongside an alphabet chart while they are learning to write and spell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whole words and phrases are not just for those who are not confident spellers, however. Someone who can spell well may still find it quicker to point to words and phrases that are commonly spoken rather than having to spell them letter-byletter each time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When creating a chart or book based around whole words alongside an alphabet chart, many of the considerations in the symbol based AAC resource around design, content and support will be relevant. You may want to consult the Getting Started with AAC: Using low tech symbol based systems with children resource.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For some, just a few words or phrases will be enough. However, for individuals who are able to point to small targets fairly accurately, you may want to consider providing a large number of words and phrases alongside the alphabet chart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English" class="bare">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English</a> for one example of a list of commonly used words in English. It’s amazing how often we use the same words in our speech. It could be a great help to the individual not to have to spell each one out every time. We can also be quite repetitive in the phrases we use in our conversation. For example, “How are you?”, “How was your day?”, etc! Again, it can be helpful to have these written down so that you simply have to point to the phrase rather than spelling it out each time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alongside, or indeed instead of, commonly spoken words or phrases, you may want to include useful problem solving phrases like “mistake”, “start over”, “I don’t understand”, “you decide please”, “It’s not here”, “can you add a phrase for me”, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some individuals may benefit from the inclusion of consonant blends on their alphabet chart. This can be particularly useful for those who find selecting letters slow as it means that two or more are selected at one time. The most obvious one to include is ‘QU’ as the letter ‘Q’ rarely occurs in isolation in English. However, other blends to consider alongside the alphabet include ‘SH’, ‘CH’, ‘TH’, and common word endings like ‘-ING’ and ‘-ED’.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A ‘space’ or ‘word end’ option can be invaluable to make word endings clear. Some people also find punctuation useful, particularly full stops and question marks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_punctuation"><a class="anchor" href="#_punctuation"></a><a class="link" href="#_punctuation">Punctuation</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people like to have punctuation on their alphabet chart to further clarify their message. Full stops are a particularly useful way of indicating that a message is complete. Without them there is a risk that the communication partner will think a message is finished when there is actually more to say.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other punctuation can be useful too. Use of an exclamation mark can change the perspective on the message, although some prefer to clarify this using body language or vocalisation. Similarly, some people find a question mark to be helpful. Again, it’s really down to the individual.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_numbers"><a class="anchor" href="#_numbers"></a><a class="link" href="#_numbers">Numbers</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As in some of the examples above, some people find the inclusion of numbers on an alphabet chart useful. If you can afford the space on the chart, it does save someone from having to spell out the numerals. Useful characters alongside numbers that you might want include are ‘£’, ‘:’ for when talking about time, and ‘%’.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, some people find it helpful to have a separate numbers chart, alongside their alphabet chart, or even printed on the reverse.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Personalising an alphabet chart can increase motivation to use it. It can also provide a great talking point! Google images can provide a wealth of resources to support this. You could include the logo of a favourite sports team, or you could add pictures of characters from a favourite TV show, photographs of family or friends, or anything that is of particular interest. You may be able to download wallpapers of favourite teams, pop groups etc. from the internet and place these behind the chart too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes simply making the chart using someone’s favourite colours can add interest and appeal.</p>

<p>When we talk about a communication partner we mean ‘you’! A communication partner is a person with whom the person who uses AAC communicates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication is a two way process, and requires skills from both parties – hence the importance of communication partner skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication does go wrong sometimes, even when speech is involved! Don’t panic – just acknowledge the problem and see if you can work round it.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_good_communication_partner_skills"><a class="anchor" href="#_good_communication_partner_skills"></a><a class="link" href="#_good_communication_partner_skills">Good Communication Partner Skills</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you can, choose a quiet place to talk with as few background distractions as possible. Try to face the person you are talking to, as this will help you read their body language and facial expressions. Note though that sometimes people with a visual difficulty will find it easier if you stand on one side or another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the communication partner, try to give the person using AAC time to construct their message. Conversation can quickly become very confused if you rush in to fill the silence with another question or observation, as it can become unclear which question or observation the person using AAC is then responding to. It can feel strange at first, but try to relax during the silence. Let the person using AAC finish what they are saying before rushing onto the next part of the conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep your own language simple, but don’t fall into the trap of only asking questions that someone can answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to as this makes for a rather boring conversation for both parties! Try to just introduce one topic of conversation at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Misunderstandings can happen in all conversations, but do tend to occur more frequently in conversations involving AAC. Don’t worry about it. If one or both of you seems confused say so, and try to get to the bottom of it. If you are really lost, you could try using the following questions to help get things back on track:
1. Who are we talking about?
2. What situation are we talking about?
3. Is it something that happened in the present, the past or
has yet to take place?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, you could ask to start again and have another go at understanding the message. If that doesn’t work, do acknowledge the problem rather than pretending it hasn’t happened. You could always offer to come back to it another time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Module Four of the freely available online learning resources on <a href="http://aacscotland.org.uk" class="bare">aacscotland.org.uk</a> provides more detailed information about being a good communication partner, and offers some excellent downloadable resources.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a person frequently uses a low tech alphabet chart to communicate it can be helpful for the communication partner to have a notebook and pen. This can help them to keep track of a long or complex message being spelled out.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_guessing"><a class="anchor" href="#_guessing"></a><a class="link" href="#_guessing">Guessing</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some individuals find it very helpful if their communication partner attempts to guess a word before they have finished spelling it out. Communication partners can be very good at it and surprisingly accurate, particularly when context is known. For example, if you are discussing holiday destinations and someone starts spelling a word with ‘F’, you may quickly guess that they are planning a holiday to France. This can significantly speed up a conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, other individuals dislike someone guessing their message. They may find it intrusive or annoying.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is therefore helpful to establish whether or not guessing is permitted in advance. Some individuals may choose to record their preferences in a <a href="#_chapter_6_communication_passports_drawing_it_all_together">communication passport</a>. Others may choose to have instructions to the communication partner written directly onto their alphabet chart, as shown in the following example.</p>

<p>Communication passports are a way of drawing together and sharing information about how a person communicates. A communication passport can give information both about a person’s understanding and how they express themselves. They are a really helpful tool to have alongside any form of AAC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A communication passport is often a printed document. However, some people also find it helpful to have a video passport alongside the printed version. It is sometimes much easier to show someone’s ‘yes’ and ‘no’ response, and how it might vary with fatigue, for example, rather than trying to describe it in words. You may also find communication passports made as a powerpoint presentation. If someone uses a high tech communication aid, it may be worth keeping a copy of the communication passport on the device itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When developing a communication passport, it is essential to involve the person in its development as much as possible. The individual needs to have ownership of their communication passport, particularly if it is written in ‘their’ voice. Person-centred planning approaches has a useful role to play here.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes you will need to make and customise your own alphabet chart, as none of the off-the-shelf solutions will do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simplest way of doing this is to make a table within word processing software. However, if you have access to specially designed resource making software, you may find this offers a bit more flexibility. Some also include templates of alphabet charts. Examples of such software in the UK includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Boardmaker Plus! V6, Boardmaker Studio or Boardmaker Online e.g. available from <a href="http://www.tobiidynavox.com" class="bare">www.tobiidynavox.com</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes you can access such software through your local Speech and Language Therapy service or through a child’s educational environment. There are also a few counties that offer access to such software through their library service. You could contact your local library service to find out if this is available in your area. Some charities / non-profit organisations also offer access to software.</p>

<dt><a id="aac"></a> AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The term used to describe various methods of communication that can be used as an alternative or as an ‘add-on’ to speech where speech is not sufficient to enable successful communication in all situations all of the time. AAC includes simples systems such as pictures, gestures and pointing, as well as more complex techniques involving powerful computer technology.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="access-method"></a> Access method</dt>
<dd>
<p>Refers to the method by which an individual accesses their communication system. Also known as the selection method.</p>
