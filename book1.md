## Getting Started with AAC: Designing and using alphabet charts

<img src="assets/images/CoverDesigningAlphabet.png" alt="cover image" style="width: 200px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 8px 0px;"/>

The aim of this resource is help you design and use alphabet charts with people who can’t rely on speech, enabling them to communicate to the best of their ability.  Through communication we can express ourselves, learn, have fun, and be active members of society

Please note that this resource is not suggesting that low tech is ‘best’, or that low tech is a prerequisite to a more high tech communication aid.  It is simply about valuing the role of paper based communication systems, and sharing lots of ideas and strategies to help develop and support them.  You may well find that many of the ideas and strategies are useful when it comes to other forms of communication too.
