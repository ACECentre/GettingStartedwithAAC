Three books have been designed to help families and professionals alike to get started with Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). These have been edited by the [ACE Centre](http://acecentre.org.uk), a UK charity providing information, advice and support for individuals who require technology to communicate.

* [Book 1 - "Getting Started with AAC: Designing and using alphabet charts"](book1/) discusses how to develop an alphabet chart, with videos and examples of how to use them.
* [Book 2 - "Getting Started with AAC: Using low tech symbol based systems with children"](book2/) introduces low tech symbol based AAC to support individuals who canâ€™t rely on speech to communicate to the best of their ability.  
* [Book 3 - "Getting Started with AAC: Access to low tech symbol based resources when pointing is difficult"](book3/) explores alternate ways of accessing low tech symbol based AAC where a child/young person/adult has physical or visual difficulties that make standard resources hard to use.  This book is aimed at people who are familiar with low tech AAC and want to find out more about how to adjust and adapt the resources to meet individual needs.

We really hope they are useful. Please do share information on these resources and [let us know](http://acecentre.org.uk/contact-us) of any comments/improvements.
